const body = `## PLEASE WAIT is the whole product

[ReShortFly](https://reshortfly.com/) aliases open a banner page titled PLEASE WAIT TO PROCEED TO THE DESTINATION PAGE. A Seconds readout counts down while Get Link stays disabled as Please wait. Extra Get a link / Download tiles around the page are ads—not the unlock. Leave early, reload mid-count, or fight an ad-block wall and the same please wait seconds loop starts again.

The on-screen timer is not only decoration. Unlock rejects Get Link until that delay has actually elapsed, which is why a reshortfly timer bypass has to wait honestly once, then finish—not zero the label and hope.

### What you see on the alias

- PLEASE WAIT TO PROCEED TO THE DESTINATION PAGE headline
- Seconds countdown before anything useful is enabled
- Please wait disabled control that later becomes Get Link
- Ad tiles labeled Get a link or Download that are not the destination

## Cover the wait, then Get Link

On supported ReShortFly short URLs, Skip Wait drops a full-page overlay with its own countdown for the enforced delay. When unlock is allowed, it completes Get Link and opens whatever URL that step returns—another shortener or a direct page.

You do not hunt the real control under ads, and you do not babysit the Seconds strip by hand. That is a reshortfly countdown bypass and get link shortener bypass inside Chrome for this host.

## Ads are not unlock

The floating Download creatives and Get a link buttons are monetization chrome. Skip Wait ignores them and only finishes the real Get Link path after the wait. A reshortfly chrome extension install covers this waiting page; if the destination is another supported shortener, stay on the tab for that brand’s rule.
