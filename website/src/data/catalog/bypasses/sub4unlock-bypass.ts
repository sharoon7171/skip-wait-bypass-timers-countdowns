  'A Sub4Unlock bypass or sub4unlock password bypass search usually means a share with up to ten creator task slots—subscribe, follow, join, like, comment, custom links—then a countdown and an optional password screen. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that reads the destination on supported unlock pages so skip waiting page busywork is not a full checklist.';

const body = `## Ten task slots, then Get Link, then a password

Sub4Unlock on the main product hosts can require a long slot list before Get Link works: subscribe, follow, join, like, comment, or custom outbound links—sometimes all the way through url1–url10 style steps. After the slots, a countdown still holds the unlock, and some pages add a password or code gate. That stacked checklist is why sub4unlock timer bypass and sub4unlock social unlock queries differ from a single YouTube subscribe wall.

The destination is already on the unlock page. The product is forcing every slot green before redirect.

### Checklist friction that is not a shortener timer

- Multi-slot creator tasks (subscribe, follow, join, like, comment, custom)
- Countdown waits before Get Link enables
- Password and code gates on the final page
- Manual continue loops after a failed slot

## Matching /S/, LP, and LPD unlock pages

Skip Wait matches supported unlock page shapes, reads the destination already present, and redirects without requiring each task slot to be completed by hand.

Client slot gating and countdown busywork disappear. That is a Sub4Unlock bypass extension for multi-slot checklists—not a WhatsApp/TikTok locker tour.
