const body = `## Play countdowns on SCORM training slides

Articulate Storyline-style SCORM packages often force you to sit through a timed content block before Next enables. The slide already loaded; the course play countdown is the gate—exactly why storyline scorm timer bypass and skip countdown timer queries appear next to generic skip waiting page help when you only wanted to finish the module.

This is not a shortener chain. It is in-player lockouts on supported training hosts.

### Locks that pad every slide

- Course play countdown waits before advance
- SCORM slide timer blocks on Next / Continue
- Timed content locks that ignore reading speed
- Manual scrubbing that still refuses until the clock ends

## Advancing when the slide is already ready

Skip Wait activates on recognized skip course wait flows. On supported training pages it clears or automates the play countdown so you can move to the next block without watching the full timer.

You open the SCORM content as usual—no paste tool. That is a Storyline SCORM bypass extension for timed slides, not a link shortener helper. Client delay theater disappears; any LMS check that still must complete finishes honestly.
