const body = `## The /st hop is the stall

Ontops shares that use the /st path carry the next address in the link itself, then still force a hop screen before you leave. If the hop blocks, bans, or spins, you never reach what was already encoded on the URL.

That single stall is the Ontops problem: a traffic gate between the click and the destination the publisher already attached.

### What burns time on Ontops

- /st hop pages before the real destination
- Intermediate gate chrome that can block or ban the tab
- Manual reloads when the hop never releases
- Waiting on a screen that does not own the final content

## Opening the encoded destination from the hop

Skip Wait detects supported Ontops /st pages in Chrome, reads the destination already present on that link, and navigates there without depending on the hop UI to finish.

You stay on the tab you opened until the destination loads. Client hop theater is skipped; there is no paste tool and no second extension for this brand alone.
