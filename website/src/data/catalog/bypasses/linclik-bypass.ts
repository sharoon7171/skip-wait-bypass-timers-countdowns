  'A Linclik bypass search usually means a short URL parked you on a continue gate and an AdLinkFly-style unlock countdown instead of the destination. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that advances that waiting page and redirects when unlock is ready.';

const body = `## Continue, then unlock countdown, then the real URL

Linclik shares follow a familiar AdLinkFly pattern: a continue gate under ads, a please-wait strip, then an unlock countdown before Get Link or the redirect fires. Miss Continue or leave early and you restart the gate.

That is why linclik timer bypass and skip click to continue sit next to waiting page bypass—the destination is delayed by UI chores, not a mystery URL.

### Gates people actually sit through

- Continue buttons that stay disabled until the client timer ends
- Please-wait strips stacked over the unlock control
- AdLinkFly-style countdown before redirect
- Manual retries when ads hide Get Link

## Finishing unlock on the live waiting page

Skip Wait detects the gate, completes the continue flow the page expects, and covers unlock countdown busywork so the redirect can fire when allowed.

You open the short link as usual—no paste tool. Client-only clutter gets out of the way; any server-enforced hold still finishes honestly before the destination opens.

## Why re-clicking Continue never teaches you anything new

The unlock pattern stays the same even when ad layouts shuffle. A Linclik bypass extension that runs on the live page keeps skip waiting page useful without learning a new paste site every time the shortener tweaks chrome.
