const body = `## Three screens before the host opens

After Download on a resource post, WeaDown opens a file gate page. The banner reads that your direct link will be ready shortly, the button says Generate Secure Link, the hold screen shows Verifying Link Safety, and the unlock step finishes on View & Download File.

Consent overlays can sit on top of the button, and leaving the tab too long can expire the one-time gate.

### Friction on WeaDown file gate pages

- Generate Secure Link on every file gate URL
- Verifying Link Safety before the redirect unlocks
- View & Download File as the final click before the host
- Consent overlays blocking the download button

## Automatic unlock to the file host

On supported file gate pages, Skip Wait reads the live button labels and banner text from the page, runs the secure-link flow for you, and redirects to the file host when the server allows it. You do not need to click Generate Secure Link or chase the ready state.

The overlay follows the same labels the site shows—Generate Secure Link, Verifying Link Safety, and View & Download File—so you always see what step is running.

## When WeaDown changes the gate wording

Skip Wait takes its labels and gate URLs from the page itself. If WeaDown renames the buttons or waiting text, the bypass keeps using the live copy without waiting for an extension update.
