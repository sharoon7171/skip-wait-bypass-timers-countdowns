  'A Sub2Get bypass search usually means a monetized short URL parked you on a subscribe-to-unlock waiting page instead of the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that please wait bypass and skip click to continue loop so the destination opens without finishing every social prompt by hand.';

const body = `## Subscribe prompts that never open the file

Sub2Get shares present as a short link but resolve to a waiting page that pushes subscribe or continue steps before redirect. You sit through please-wait chrome, hunt Continue under overlays, or bounce when the gate stalls—then the same unlock screen returns. That pattern drives sub2get timer bypass, waiting page bypass, and link shortener bypass searches when you only wanted the destination.

Unlike multi-slot creator lockers, this flow is a single shortener gate: delay UI first, destination second.

### Gate behaviors that eat the click

- Subscribe-to-unlock waiting pages
- Please-wait and click-to-continue screens
- Gate pages before the destination URL
- Manual continue loops after a stalled unlock

## Leaving the gate on the live short URL

When the waiting page loads, Skip Wait runs in the background, skips the delay layer the shortener already uses, and sends you to the target URL supported for Sub2Get.

No paste box—just a Sub2Get bypass extension that treats the unlock wait as automation. Client busywork disappears; any hold the shortener still enforces finishes honestly.
