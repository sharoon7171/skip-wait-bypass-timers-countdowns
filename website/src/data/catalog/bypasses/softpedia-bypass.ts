  'Looking for a Softpedia bypass or download timer skip usually means you already picked a mirror and still hit a generating wait before the real file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that resolves the direct download path after mirror selection so skip waiting page busywork is not another hop.';

const body = `## Mirror chosen—then another generating screen

Softpedia download flows often sit a waiting page, generating timer, or intermediary redirect after you pick a mirror. The software page already knows where the file lives; the extra screen is delay theater before the CDN path starts. That pattern drives softpedia timer bypass, direct download bypass, and file host bypass searches when you only wanted the installer.

Refreshing the wait page rarely helps. The file URL is resolved separately from the countdown UI.

### After-click delays people actually hit

- Post-download waiting pages after mirror selection
- Generating timers before the file link appears
- Intermediary redirect pages before the CDN
- Extra waits on mirror and host buttons

## Resolving the file URL in the background

Skip Wait runs on matching Softpedia download pages. When you use the same download or mirror control you already click, the extension resolves the real file URL in the background and bypasses the timer or redirect page that normally follows.

Client delay chrome gets out of the way. That is a Softpedia bypass extension for direct download—not a third-party paste site that asks you to copy the page URL again.
