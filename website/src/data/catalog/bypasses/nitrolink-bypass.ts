Open a Nitro Link alias and the shortener wants to leave for article waits—Level Step labels, Please wait, Continue, Next Step—before Your link is almost ready. Skip Wait keeps the tab on Nitro Link. You do not open those article pages yourself.

TinyURL or other wrappers that only forward into a Nitro Link alias land on the same short link. Once you are on Nitro Link, this bypass applies.

### What you actually see

- The Nitro Link short URL you opened
- Your link is almost ready with a short Get Link timer
- Get Link after that timer

## Your link is almost ready

The real hold is the Get Link timer on Your link is almost ready. Skip Wait shows that countdown from the page, waits only that time, then unlocks and opens the destination.

No babysitting Continue on article hops. That is a Nitro Link bypass that treats the short link as the whole job.
