  'A BoostyLink bypass search usually means a content locker still wants a stack of actions plus a server unlock timer before Continue works. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that runs those locker steps for you and opens the destination when unlock completes.';

const body = `## Locker actions stacked before unlock

BoostyLink pages are not a single countdown strip. You start locker actions, wait a server-side unlock timer, complete each step, then finally navigate. Miss an action or leave mid-timer and the sequence resets. That is why boostylink content locker, content locker action bypass, and locker unlock timer queries show up beside generic skip countdown timer searches.

### What you would tap by hand

- Manual locker action starts and completes
- Server unlock timer busywork on the page
- Get Link delay screens after the actions finish
- Return-URL navigation you still have to click

## Completing the action loop in Chrome

Skip Wait starts the locker actions, waits out the unlock timer the server still enforces, completes each action, and opens the destination URL automatically. Cosmetic UI babysitting disappears; the honest server hold remains. One BoostyLink bypass extension install covers matching pages—no paste box and no userscript pack.

## Return URLs after the timer finishes

When the locker returns a destination—including return links from sites that use BoostyLink as their shortener—Skip Wait navigates there once unlock is allowed.
