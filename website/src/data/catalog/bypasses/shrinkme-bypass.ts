const body = `## Captcha first, then blogs, then another clock

ShrinkMe shares rarely open in one hop. You clear an entry check, land on a rotating article with Continue buried under ads, then return for a go-page countdown that only unlocks after the mediators cooperate. Leave mid-chain and the monetized link bypass hunt starts again—exactly the loop behind shrinkme timer bypass and skip waiting page searches.

The shortener’s model is dwell time: captcha, blog hop, unlock timer. Each layer is real page work, not a single fake redirect.

### Layers that reset if you bail early

- Entry captcha gates before any continue control
- Blog mediator articles with please-wait strips
- Go-page countdown and unlock redirect hops
- Session loss when a hop opens in the wrong tab

## Automating the chain without a paste box

Skip Wait starts on the short URL you opened and advances the same gates the shortener already expects—captcha stays visible when a human check is required, blog continues complete without button hunting, and the unlock screen progresses once the chain is ready.

Client chrome gets out of the way; server-side holds still finish honestly. That is a ShrinkMe bypass extension that stays useful when mediator hosts rotate, unlike paste APIs keyed to last week’s blog list.
