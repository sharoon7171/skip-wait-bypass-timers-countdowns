  'People searching for a ShrtFly bypass or shrtslug bypass usually cleared a verify hop only to land on publisher pages with Turnstile, progress bars, and another countdown. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that runs that ad link shortener bypass on the live chain so skip waiting page busywork is not your job.';

const body = `## Verify hops into rotating publisher pages

Ad-gated ShrtFly shorteners force a verify step, then bounce you through publisher articles that pin Turnstile, show progress bars, and hold Continue until a client timer finishes. Only after that tour does a speed-token redirect open the real URL—why turnstile short link and bypass shrtfly queries spike next to generic skip countdown timer searches.

Entry slug hosts and publisher mediators are one network. Closing a publisher tab early usually voids the unlock session.

### Screens that dominate the free path

- Forced verify / human-check continue clicks
- Publisher interstitial continue loops
- Progress-bar and countdown unlock screens
- Manual next-hop form submissions after Turnstile

## Overlay, Turnstile, then the final redirect

Skip Wait shows an unlock overlay on matching short links, submits the entry verify hop the page already expects, pins Turnstile on mediator pages when a human check is required, respects only server-enforced unlock timers, follows speed-token redirects, and opens the final link.

You still complete Turnstile once when shown. What disappears is hunting Continue through ads and replaying progress bars by hand. That is a shrtfly bypass extension install that tracks behavior—not last week’s publisher hostname.
