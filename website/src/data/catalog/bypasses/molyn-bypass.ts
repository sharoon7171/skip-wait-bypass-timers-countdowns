  'Molyn Development’s free Standard Key still sends you through Start Checkpoints, five Go to Offer hops, and Finish Line before Access Key appears. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that opens the keysystem, skips that Linkvertise tour, and puts the Access Key on screen with Copy key so you can paste it into the Molyn hub.';

const body = `## Free Standard Key that still wants five offers

On the Molyn keysystem you pick **Standard Key - Linkvertise**, tap **Start Checkpoints**, then walk Checkpoint 1 of 5 through Checkpoint 5 of 5. Each step pushes **Go to Offer**, asks you to finish the offer on the next page, and only then advances. Miss the order and you see access-denied style walls instead of the key.

Roblox script users looking for a molyn free key or molyn access key hit the same loop: Start Checkpoints looks quick, then Linkvertise offers stack until Finish Line finally says Your Key is Ready.

### What the keysystem actually asks for

- **Choose your method** with Standard Key - Linkvertise and Complete 5 checkpoints
- **Start Checkpoints** into Checkpoint 1 of 5
- **Go to Offer** on every checkpoint, plus Complete the offer in the next page to continue
- Labels like START, UNLOCK, ACCESS, VERIFY, and CLAIM across the five steps
- **FINISH LINE** / Your Key is Ready with Access Key and Copy Key
- Paste this key in the MOLYN hub to activate your access

Premium, Discord boost, and Robux lifetime options stay paid side doors—this Molyn bypass targets the free Standard Key Linkvertise path.

## Cover the tour, show Access Key

Open the keysystem, a checkpoint page, or Finish Line with Skip Wait enabled. The extension covers the page so you are not babysitting Go to Offer, skips the Linkvertise checkpoint tour, and fetches the Access Key. When it lands, you see the key and tap **Copy key**—nothing is forced onto the clipboard until you choose.

If the Access Key cannot load, Skip Wait opens Molyn’s manual paste fallback instead of leaving you stuck mid-checkpoint.

## Finish Line without replaying Go to Offer

Finish Line is where Molyn normally proves you finished every checkpoint. With Skip Wait you do not need to replay Redirecting to offer… or the five offer hops just to reach Your Key is Ready. Copy the Access Key, paste it in the Molyn hub, and keep scripting.

For Linkvertise access steps on other sites, see the [Linkvertise bypass](/sites/linkvertise-bypass) page—Molyn’s free path uses that stack as the offer layer, but Skip Wait clears the Molyn keysystem itself so you never have to start those offers from Start Checkpoints.
