const body = `## Portals that stall before the catalog

OlaMovies rotates catalog hosts often enough that public entry points are portals, not the movie index. Those pages stall behind View Main Site, a VPN modal, and brand copy about the official website while the real main URL sits behind a server pointer. Searching ola movies or OlaMovies current domain still drops you on that waiting page before any listing loads—classic skip landing wait and landing page bypass territory.

### What the portal is actually for

The portal’s job is to advertise and to publish the live catalog location. View Main Site and the VPN interrupt are friction on top of that pointer. Manual mirror lists go stale the moment the current domain rotates; the portal’s own endpoint stays authoritative.

## Following current.php into the main site

On supported portal hosts, Skip Wait reads the same current.php response the site uses to publish its live main URL, then replaces the landing with that destination. Search queries on the portal URL are preserved so an OlaMovies main site search continues after the hop. No hardcoded mirror list—one resolve path from the official portal into the catalog.

This page is only the portal hop.
