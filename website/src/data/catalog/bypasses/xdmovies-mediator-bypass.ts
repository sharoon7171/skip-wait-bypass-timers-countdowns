const body = `## After the homepage: the download mediator hop

Streaming entry waits and download mediators are different problems. Once you leave the homepage for a file, some XDMovies shares route through an extra waiting page—verification chrome, continue loops, countdown strips—before the host link appears. Miss Continue under ads or refresh mid-wait and the same waiting page bypass starts again.

That mid-chain stall is why xdmovies download mediator and xdmovies mediator timer bypass sit next to generic please wait bypass queries.

### What the mediator usually adds

- Extra please-wait screens on the download path
- Click-to-continue gates buried in overlays
- Verification delays before the file host
- Manual continue loops that reset on a bad click

## Clearing the hop inside Chrome

Skip Wait runs on the mediator page you already opened. It skips the busywork delay layer, advances continue when the flow allows, and sends you toward the file URL without a paste box. Client clutter goes away; any hold the hop still requires finishes honestly.

## Why this is not the same as the landing wait

Landing Open main site delays block browsing. Mediator waits block the file after browsing already worked. An xdmovies mediator bypass extension keyed to that second hop stays useful when download partners rotate skins, without relearning each interstitial by hand.
