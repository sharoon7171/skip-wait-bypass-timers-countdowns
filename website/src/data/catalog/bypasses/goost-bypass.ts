  'People hunting a Goost bypass or Goost recaptcha fix usually hit a monetized short URL that parks them on continue gates, a blog wait, then a human check before any destination appears. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that advances those timers, pins the captcha once, and finishes unlock from the statistics page.';

const body = `## Short links that end in a statistics unlock

A Goost share is rarely one redirect. Verification gates and continue screens come first, then a blog wait timer, then a reCAPTCHA that blocks the go page until a human token exists. Only after that does the statistics unlock URL reveal where you were going.

That sequence is why goost waiting page and short link bypass queries sit next to goost timer bypass—the pain is the checklist, not one cosmetic clock.

### Checklist most visitors actually face

1. Survive continue and blog wait timers after the short link
2. Complete reCAPTCHA when the gate demands a human check
3. Pass the go page into the statistics unlock hop
4. Hope the session still accepts the unlock after the captcha

## Continue gates without babysitting every hop

On supported Goost pages, Skip Wait skips continue and blog wait busywork, then pins reCAPTCHA over the overlay so you can solve it once. After the token is present it continues through the statistics unlock until the destination opens.

Timers the shortener still enforces server-side are waited honestly. Disabled unlock chrome and button hunting get out of the way. That is skip short link as a live browser path—not a paste API that dies when the next gate host changes.

## Captcha stays human; babysitting does not

Skip Wait never claims to farm reCAPTCHA. It keeps the widget usable so one solve unlocks the rest of the flow. A Goost bypass extension install that runs on the gates you already opened stays useful when blog or unlock hosts rotate, as long as the same short-link pattern remains.
