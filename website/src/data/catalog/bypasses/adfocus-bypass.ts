  'An AdFocus bypass search usually begins after a monetized download link opens an ad interstitial instead of the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that waiting page so you are not repeating continue clicks on a single gate.';

const body = `## Download shares that open an ad interstitial

AdFocus-style links put paid creative between the click and the real URL. You stare at an adfocus waiting page, hunt skip click to continue, and still risk a reset if the gate reloads. That single-hop tax is why adfocus timer bypass and monetized download bypass searches stay common next to generic please wait bypass queries.

Unlike multi-blog shorteners, the product here is usually one interstitial: burn time, show ads, then release.

### What the interstitial demands

- Ad waiting chrome before the file destination
- Please-wait strips that re-enable Continue on a client clock
- Gate pages that exist only to pad the hop
- Manual continue loops when the button hides under creatives

## One gate, then the file

Skip Wait detects the AdFocus gate in Chrome, advances past continue busywork when the flow allows, and redirects to the destination already tied to the share. You stay on the tab you opened—an AdFocus bypass extension install is enough, with no paste site in the middle.

Cosmetic delay theater clears; required checks still complete honestly.
