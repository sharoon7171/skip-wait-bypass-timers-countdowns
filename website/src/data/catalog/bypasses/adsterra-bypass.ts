const body = `## Checkpoint ends on a key, not a file URL

A gated FF Gaming-style unlock opens Checkpoint with Progress, Session Token, and WAITING. The site wants COMPLETE STEP hops, Verify bars, and an 11-second CONTINUE clock. When the session finishes, Status becomes READY and a key box shows a string like a product code—not a Direct Download button.

People often hunt for a destination link after Done. On this flow there is none: the checkpoint reward key in that box is the unlock. Copy it, then paste where the game or mod asks for a key.

### What the waiting tour looks like

- Checkpoint card with Current Step / Total Steps and WAITING
- COMPLETE STEP buttons that open Adsterra-heavy step tabs
- CONTINUE TO NEXT PAGE locked behind a circle countdown
- Fake Verify loading before SCROLL DOWN
- READY state with the key box plus COPY KEY on the page

## Finishing without babysitting every hop

Skip Wait advances supported Checkpoint steps in Chrome until Status is READY. The overlay surfaces the reward key and can copy it for you so you are not stuck wondering where the download went.

Client countdown chrome drops away; you still end on the same Secure Checkpoint session with a key to paste.

## Labels stay even when ads change

Creatives rotate, but the UI keeps saying Checkpoint, COMPLETE STEP, and Secure Checkpoint System. An Adsterra checkpoint bypass keyed to READY + the key box stays useful when the ad wall changes and the prize is still a copyable code.
