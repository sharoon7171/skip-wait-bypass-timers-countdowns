const intro =
  'A Boostellar bypass or Bstshrt bypass search usually starts when a monetized short link freezes behind a content locker countdown. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that locker gate so the destination opens without watching the unlock clock by hand.';

const body = `## Content lockers that freeze Get Link

Boostellar and Bstshrt shares park a content locker between the short alias and the long URL. Continue or Get Link stays disabled until the countdown finishes, even when the destination is already known. That stall is why boostellar content locker, content locker countdown skip, and get link delay bypass queries sit next to generic skip countdown timer searches.

### What the locker holds

- Unlock countdowns before Continue enables
- Content locker chrome on monetized short URLs
- Get Link delay screens after the timer
- Manual babysitting when the page resets mid-count

## Monetized short URLs past the locker clock

Skip Wait runs on the live locker page in Chrome, advances past countdown busywork when the flow allows, and opens the destination once unlock is permitted. One Boostellar / Bstshrt bypass extension install covers the matching hosts listed on this page—no paste form and no per-link toggle.

Client-only delay theater clears; if the locker still enforces a real server hold, Skip Wait finishes that hold honestly, then continues.
