const intro =
  'A LootLabs bypass usually means a shared unlock dropped you onto a content locker with a wait timer and survey copy instead of the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that runs the locker timer automatically, handles Turnstile when the page requires it, and redirects when the destination releases.';

const body = `## Lockers that stall on timers, not one click

A LootLabs monetized link lands on a content locker—often \`/s\` on \`links.lootlabs.gg\` or a partner host—with a countdown and task text that implies surveys or ad gates. Close the tab early or refresh mid-flow and you restart from the first screen.

That friction is why loot link bypass and lootlabs timer bypass searches cluster together—the payload sits behind a release timer, not a single redirect.

### What the locker usually shows

- A wait countdown before the destination unlocks
- Survey-style task titles on the locker page
- Turnstile human verification on some unlocks
- Partner domains that redirect into the same locker stack

## Bypassing the locker inside Chrome

Skip Wait runs on supported LootLabs-family locker pages. It hooks the live unlock flow, runs the wait timer automatically, and shows a Skip Wait overlay with the remaining countdown—no survey tasks to click through.

When the locker requires Turnstile, the check appears in the overlay while the timer keeps running. Once the server releases the link, Skip Wait redirects automatically without showing the destination URL in the overlay.

## Partner locker hosts use the same pattern

Paste boxes go stale when locker domains rotate. Skip Wait keys off the live \`/s\` locker page on supported hosts—including \`loot-link.com\`, \`lootdest\` mirrors, and \`rapid-links\` family domains—so the bypass keeps working after partner redirects land on the same locker stack.
