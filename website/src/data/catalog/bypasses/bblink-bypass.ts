const body = `## Five continue cards before Get Link

[BBLINK](https://web.bbmkts.com/) shares on this host do not unlock in one tap. You climb Step 1/5 through Step 5/5, each with its own Seconds countdown and Click here to continue control. After the last continue, a Get Link style unlock still holds for a short server timer before the destination is released.

Reload mid-chain and the step counter starts over. That stacked continue path is the BBLINK waiting-page tax—not a single cosmetic ring.

### What the alias puts in front of you

- Step N/5 indicators on each continue card
- Seconds countdown before Click here to continue enables
- Locked continue buttons between steps
- A final Get Link / unlock countdown after the last continue

## Finishing the alias without babysitting each step

Skip Wait runs on the BBLINK alias you already opened. It advances the continue forms the page already posts, skips client-only delay theater on those cards, honors the short unlock hold when the server still requires it, then opens the destination Get Link would have returned.

You stay on the tab through the chain. No paste tool—just the BBLINK path.
