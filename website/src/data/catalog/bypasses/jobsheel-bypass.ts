  'A JobSheel bypass search usually means a short hop parked you on a human check, then stacked Continue pages before a Babylinks Get Link wait. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that starts on that short hop, opens jobsheel.com after the check, walks Continue, and finishes go.babylinks.in unlock in the same path.';

const body = `## Baby check, Continue stack, then Babylinks

[JobSheel](https://jobsheel.com/) sits after unlock shorteners such as [Unlock To Earn](/sites/unlock-to-earn-bypass). After the baby.php human check, the site expects home and article Continue screens, then Get Link into go.babylinks.in. Miss a hop or close a tab early and the path stalls—why people look for jobsheel timer bypass, babylinks bypass, and link shortener bypass help instead of babysitting every gate.

### Where progress usually dies

- Human check on baby.php before anything else starts
- Home and article Continue buttons under ads
- Client unlock timers before the next form submit
- go.babylinks.in please-wait / Get Link delay before the destination

## Walking JobSheel in one tab

Skip Wait follows the live JobSheel path in Chrome. It starts on a real baby.php short-link hop—opening the plain homepage alone does not turn on the bypass. After you finish the human check, it creates the session, opens jobsheel.com directly, and advances Continue steps the page already expects.

When Get Link points at go.babylinks.in, the same JobSheel rule imports the Links Go unlock helpers and finishes that waiting page—no separate AdLinkFly host entry required. Ads stop hiding each button. Client waits get out of the way. The next destination opens in the same tab.
