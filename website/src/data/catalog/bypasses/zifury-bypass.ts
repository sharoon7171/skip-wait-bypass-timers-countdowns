Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that runs that guest path for you and opens the save as soon as the host allows it.';

const body = `## GUEST DOWNLOAD and a second wait after it

On a typical Zifury file page the free tier card shows GUEST DOWNLOAD first. After you press it, a PLEASE WAIT badge counts down in seconds. When the timer ends, the page swaps to Fetching download link and only then shows Download with the filename.

Some shares add a NEXT STEP hop before the final save button. Either way you are clicking through guest chrome instead of grabbing the file.

### What slows a Zifury free save

- GUEST DOWNLOAD before anything starts
- PLEASE WAIT seconds on the free tier card
- Fetching download link after the countdown
- Extra NEXT STEP screens on multi-hop shares

## Unlock without babysitting the guest card

On supported Zifury file pages, Skip Wait covers the guest gate with its own overlay, keeps the PLEASE WAIT timer off your screen, and continues the unlock in the background. When the host is ready, it sends you straight to the save—no GUEST DOWNLOAD click and no hunting for the green Download button.

You still get the file the guest path would have minted; the button tour is what disappears.

## When Zifury changes the guest wording

Skip Wait reads GUEST DOWNLOAD, PLEASE WAIT, Fetching download link, and Download labels from the live page. If Zifury renames those controls or adds another guest hop, the overlay keeps matching what you would have clicked.
