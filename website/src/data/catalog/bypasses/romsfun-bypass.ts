const body = `## Download buttons trapped behind a clock

RomsFun file pages often sit a timer in front of the download or get-link step. You watch the counter, wait for the button to enable, then restart if you leave the tab early or an overlay covers the control. Across multi-disc sets and mirror retries, that pattern drives searches for skip countdown timer, countdown timer bypass, and skip timer unlock.

The ROM archive is already on the page. The countdown is theater that keeps the control disabled until the client clock finishes.

### What the unlock clock actually does

- Holds the download button until the counter hits zero
- Adds get-link delay screens before the archive
- Resets progress if you switch tabs mid-wait
- Forces a refresh when the unlock UI stalls

## Unlocking the control on the same ROM page

Skip Wait activates on matching countdown flows inside Chrome. It advances the unlock path the page already uses, reveals the download control when the site allows, and skips client-only delay theater.

Required server checks still complete honestly. You stay on the same ROM page—no paste decoder—just a RomsFun bypass extension that treats the timer as automation work. Sitting through every countdown by hand adds up; one skip wait extension install handles the supported unlock pattern so you spend time on the dump instead of the clock.
