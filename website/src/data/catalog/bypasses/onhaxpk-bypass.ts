const intro =
  'An OnhaxPK bypass or skip copy step search usually means a software page made you wait, then copy session share data by hand before downloads unlocked. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that skips that countdown and copies the string for you.';

const body = `## Unlock pages that demand a timed copy

OnhaxPK-style software unlocks often gate the file behind session share data: wait for a countdown, copy a cookie or share string, paste it somewhere else, then retry the download. Miss the window or fumble the clipboard and the instructions restart—why onhaxpk timer bypass, copy cookie bypass, and session cookie copy queries show up together.

The useful payload is the share string. The wait and manual copy are the tax.

### Clipboard without the babysitting

Skip Wait fetches the cookie or share string on the supported page, copies it to your clipboard, and keeps a Copy control available if you need it again. Client countdown busywork before that copy stops blocking you; you still use the session data the site already issued.

That is skip copy step for this host in one OnhaxPK bypass extension install—less waiting and fewer paste mistakes before the software path continues.
