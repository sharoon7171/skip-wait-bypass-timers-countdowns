const intro =
  'People hunting a LinkNext bypass or Shorte.io timer bypass usually hit an ad short link that stacks gate waits, blog mediators, and a countdown before any destination appears. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that walks that monetized path inside the browser so you are not pressing Continue on every hop.';

const body = `## Ad shorteners that sell the journey, not the hop

LinkNext and Shorte.io-style shares rarely redirect once. You clear a verification gate, survive blog mediator continues, then sit through unlock countdown chrome before the final URL opens. Captcha follow-ups can appear mid-chain.

That is why ad link bypass and monetized link bypass queries spike next to linknext timer bypass—the product is the tour.

### Layers most visitors actually survive

1. Short-link verification and gate waits
2. Blog mediator hops with please-wait / Continue UI
3. Go-page or unlock countdown before redirect
4. Session resets when a hop closes early

## Running the chain on the pages you opened

Skip Wait automates supported gate, mediator, and unlock steps for LinkNext and Shorte.io hosts. It advances the same continue actions the pages already expect, covers countdown busywork, and opens the destination when unlock is ready.

Server-enforced holds still finish honestly. Client-only clutter and button hunting get out of the way. That is skip short link as a live session—not a one-shot paste that fails when a mediator host rotates.

## Why paste boxes age poorly here

Ad networks reshuffle blog and unlock hosts while keeping the same gate pattern. A LinkNext bypass chrome (or Shorte.io bypass extension) install that keys off live behavior stays useful without re-copying URLs into third-party tools each week.
