const body = `## Verification hops stacked on monetized aliases

FC.LC-network shares rarely end in one redirect. You hit short-link verification, ad countdown chrome, go-page unlocks, and sometimes a captcha pin before the real URL appears. Leave mid-chain or miss a continue control and the same monetized link bypass loop restarts.

That sequence is why skip short link, ad link bypass, and FC.LC timer bypass sit next to FC.LC bypass extension queries—the product is the stack of gates, not a single interstitial.

### Go pages and unlock redirects in sequence

After verification you often land on a go or unlock surface with another timer. Manual babysitting means hunting buttons under ads on each step. Skip Wait treats those surfaces as one continuous short link bypass inside Chrome.

## Automating the short-link chain in Chrome

On supported network hosts the extension detects matching pages, advances verification and unlock steps the site already expects, and continues until the destination is ready. Client countdown theater stops owning the tab; holds the shortener still enforces are waited honestly.

Captcha, when required, stays visible once. After the token exists, unlock continues—so short link bypass stays a browser session, not a paste API that dies when intermediate hosts rotate.

## When the network rotates intermediate hosts

Publisher blogs and go hosts change. A skip wait extension keyed to the live unlock pattern stays useful without re-copying the alias into a third-party tool each week.
