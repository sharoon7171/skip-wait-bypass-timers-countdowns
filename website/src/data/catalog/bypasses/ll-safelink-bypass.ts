const intro =
  'Looking for an LL Safelink bypass or WordPress safelink bypass usually means a shared unlock dumped you into generate-link forms and LLAC Continue ads instead of the real destination. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that finishes the form chain, decodes the unlock, and opens the target when release is ready.';

const body = `## Generate-link forms, then LLAC Continue ads

An LL Safelink share rarely opens the file in one click. You hit a WordPress safelink form, wait through generate-link steps, then land on an LLAC Continue screen that pushes ads before releasing the real URL. Miss a form field, close an ad tab early, or lose the unlock token and the whole chain restarts.

That stacked gate is why skip safelink wait, LLAC bypass, and linegee bypass searches spike together—the unlock token is already on the page; the forms and Continue ads are the friction.

### What the safelink path actually demands

- WordPress safelink forms and generate-link waits
- LLAC Continue ad hops before unlock releases
- Manual decoding of the unlock token after Continue
- Extra please-wait screens between form and destination

## Decoding unlock on the live pages

Skip Wait’s LL Safelink support follows the live path inside Chrome. On the safelink host it completes the form chain the page already expects. On the LLAC hop it reads the unlock token, fetches the release response, and opens the destination without loading the Continue ad tab.

Client-only clutter gets out of the way; required unlock steps still finish honestly. That is skip safelink wait as a browser session—not a paste tool that breaks when the next form host changes.

## Forms rotate hosts; tokens stay on the page

Paste boxes and userscripts often fail when safelink hosts reshuffle. An LL Safelink bypass extension that runs on the pages you opened keeps working as long as the unlock pattern stays the same.
