const body = `## Generating modal between Download this File and the archive

GamesNostalgia stores classic game archives behind a download modal that generates a CDN URL after you click. That generating timer, intermediary redirect, and extra wait on mirror buttons sit between you and the zip or iso you already chose.

People look for a GamesNostalgia timer bypass, direct download bypass, and download timer skip because babysitting the modal every time adds nothing to the download itself.

## CDN resolve behind the same button

Skip Wait’s GamesNostalgia support watches the download click you already make. It resolves the real CDN file URL in the background and skips the modal wait so Download this File opens the archive directly when the host allows it.

Client-only generating chrome gets out of the way. You still use the same download button—no paste tool, no alternate mirror hunt. Retro archives stay one intentional click, not a second scavenger hunt.

## Retro archives without babysitting the modal

Sitting through the modal on every archive wastes time without changing the file. A GamesNostalgia bypass chrome or GamesNostalgia bypass extension install keeps the direct path working on supported pages so classic downloads start from the button you pressed.
