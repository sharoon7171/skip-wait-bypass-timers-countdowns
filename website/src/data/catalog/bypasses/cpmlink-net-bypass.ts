const body = `## Please check the captcha before any destination

A [CPMlink](https://cpmlink.net/) short alias never shows the final URL on the first screen. The gate asks you to Please check the captcha box to proceed to the destination page. That Google checkbox is real: you may only need the tick, or you may get Select all images… after a wrong answer. The site also runs Please disable Adblock and can strip the captcha card when the detector fires.

Only after a valid captcha post does the go page appear. Get Link is already pointed at the destination while a short cosmetic countdown and ad frames try to keep you watching. Clicking Get Link can also fire a pop-under. That mix drives cpmlink captcha bypass and cpmlink Get Link bypass—the file or page is ready after one human check, but the UI still wants dwell time.

### Stages on a typical alias

1. Please check the captcha / I’m not a robot on the alias
2. Optional image challenge if the checkbox is not enough
3. Please disable Adblock when the page thinks ads are blocked
4. Go page Get Link with a cosmetic countdown and ad chrome

## Pin the checkbox, then open Get Link

Skip Wait keeps the live alias tab and pins the site’s reCAPTCHA on the overlay so Please check the captcha stays in reach. When the image challenge opens, it stays on top so you can finish Select all images… without the page chrome eating clicks. After the token is accepted, the extension moves to the go page, ignores the cosmetic timer and adblock wall, and opens the URL Get Link already stores.

Miss a grid and need another try—the human check stays on the same tab. Skip Wait does not farm reCAPTCHA for you; it only keeps the real widget usable and clears the busywork after you succeed.

This CPMlink path is separate from other similarly named short-link brands. Support here is for the hosts listed on this page.
