const body = `## Ad-monetized hops before the final URL

CPMLink-style shares rarely resolve in one step. You bounce through verification gates, ad link countdown timers, and go-page unlock hops before the destination appears. Close a tab early and the chain can reset—hence cpmlink countdown bypass, monetized link bypass, and go page unlock bypass searches from people who just want the final URL.

### What the chain inserts

- Short-link verification gates
- Ad link countdown timers
- Go page and unlock redirect hops
- Extra checks before the destination is released

## Walking verification and unlock screens

Skip Wait automates the short link bypass steps on supported CPMLink hosts: it continues through gates and unlock waits until the destination URL is ready. One CPMLink bypass extension install covers the matching pages listed here—no paste box and no per-hop userscript.

Timers the platform still enforces server-side are waited honestly; client busywork and button hunting go away.
