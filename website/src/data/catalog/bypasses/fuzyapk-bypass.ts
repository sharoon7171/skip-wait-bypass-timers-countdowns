const body = `## Continue, then a ten-second almost-ready stall

[FUZY APK](https://fuzyapk.com/) starts many games and apps on a **Continue to Download** screen. That click does not hand you the file. It opens the real download URL, parks the big button on **Your link is almost ready, please wait…**, and only later flips it to **Download** with the size on the label.

That fuzyapk 10 second wait is the choke point. Continue already chose the build; the almost-ready line is only a client delay before the same button unlocks. A fuzyapk timer bypass and download timer skip matter here because the file target is already on the page—the wait is theater.

### What you sit through on the download hop

- Continue to Download on the first step screen
- Refresh onto the download URL with the large button locked
- Your link is almost ready, please wait… while the button stays disabled
- About ten seconds before Download (size) appears
- Site notes under the button about AdBlock and install tips

## Skip Wait on the FUZY APK download page

Skip Wait is a FUZY APK bypass chrome / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On a supported download page it skips the almost-ready delay so Download shows immediately, with a short Skip Wait note in the site’s own download-notice style under the button.

You stay on FUZY APK. Tap Continue to Download when you need that step, land on the download URL, and use Download without a fuzyapk countdown bypass stare-down. That is skip fuzyapk waiting-page busywork and skip waiting page relief on the hop that actually stalls.

## Why the almost-ready line feels longer than ten seconds

Ads around Continue, a smartlink tab that may open, then the locked Download button stack. Leave mid-wait, miss Download when it appears, or reopen the download URL and you watch Your link is almost ready, please wait… again.

A FUZY APK bypass extension only removes that countdown. You still pick the build and use the site’s Download label—bypass fuzyapk delay without pasting the link into another tool.
