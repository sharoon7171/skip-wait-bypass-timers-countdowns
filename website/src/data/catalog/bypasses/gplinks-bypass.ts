  'A GPLinks bypass matters when a shared short link opens Premium upsells, then intermediate please-wait pages, then a Get Link countdown with Cloudflare Turnstile. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that takes Continue with ads, finishes the required intermediate hold, and clears Get Link busywork so you are not babysitting every VERIFY and CONTINUE.';

const body = `## Premium first, then intermediate waits, then Get Link

A typical GP Links short URL stacks three walls. First the shortener pushes Ad Free Experience or GPLinks Premium, with Continue with ads as the free escape. Choosing ads drops you onto intermediate pages: please wait, VERIFY, CONTINUE, often Step X of Y. Only after that tour do you return for a Get Link countdown and, often, a Cloudflare Turnstile pin.

That sequence is why a gplinks waiting page or gplinks verify continue stall feels longer than a single timer—the pain is the chain, not one button.

### Stages people actually hit

1. Decline Premium and choose Continue with ads
2. Intermediate please-wait / VERIFY / CONTINUE steps before unlock is allowed
3. Get Link countdown back on the shortener
4. Cloudflare Turnstile on the go page when a human check is required

## Continue with ads, then Get Link—without babysitting

On shortener hosts, Skip Wait takes the free Continue with ads route so skip gplinks premium does not mean opening a payment wall. On supported intermediate pages it advances the same flow after the required hold—without you hunting VERIFY under ads or walking every article hop by hand. On the go page it covers Get Link countdown busywork and keeps Turnstile visible when a human check is required—the practical gplinks turnstile bypass inside Chrome.

Timers the shortener still enforces server-side are waited honestly. What disappears is the babysitting: Premium upsell clicks you did not want, CONTINUE hunting, and disabled Get Link chrome. A gplinks timer bypass here means clearing busywork, not inventing a zero-second cheat that errors out.

## Session hold vs starting over

Once the intermediate wait has finished for a live session, reopening the same short link soon after usually does not force the full hold again. After the session ages out—about ten minutes on this path—you start fresh and the required wait returns. Paste-box “gplink bypasser” tools and fragile Tampermonkey auto-click scripts often break when intermediate hosts rotate; a gplinks chrome extension that stays on the gate, intermediates, and go page keeps the live browser session instead of asking you to re-copy the URL every week.

    question: 'Does Skip Wait buy GPLinks Premium?',
    answer:
      'No. It automates the free Continue with ads path, then the intermediate steps and Get Link screen. If you already pay for Premium you may never see that free chain.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is there still a please-wait on an intermediate page?',
    answer:
      'Those pages often track waited time server-side before advance is allowed. Skip Wait finishes that hold, then continues—a gplinks timer bypass for busywork, not a fake zero-second cheat.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I still need to click VERIFY and CONTINUE myself?',
    answer:
      'On supported pages, no. Skip Wait advances those steps after the required wait so a gplinks verify continue loop is not something you babysit by hand.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can it handle Cloudflare Turnstile on Get Link?',
    answer:
      'Yes on supported go pages. The widget stays usable once; after the token exists, Get Link unlock continues. That is the practical gplinks turnstile bypass inside Chrome.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will an ad blocker break the chain?',
    answer:
      'Aggressive blockers can trigger AdBlocker detected modals on intermediate pages. Allow the shortener and that page for the session if progress stalls, then reload.',
