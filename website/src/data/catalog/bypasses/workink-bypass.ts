  'A Work.ink bypass or workink bypass search usually means a monetized short URL stuck you behind hCaptcha and an unlock gate before the real destination. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that pins the check, clears post-captcha unlock waits, and opens the target so skip short link is not a manual continue loop.';

const body = `## Captcha, then unlock, then the real URL

Work.ink short links put verification and unlock gates between the short path and your destination. You solve hCaptcha, wait for unlock, and only then reach the target. Miss the pinned check, stay logged into a publisher session that blocks the free path, or leave mid-unlock and the same monetized link bypass loop restarts.

That two-step stall is why people search Work.ink hCaptcha, hcaptcha short link, and Work.ink timer bypass together.

### Gates after the short path

- Short-link unlock screens on matching paths
- hCaptcha before unlock is allowed
- Post-captcha unlock waits before the destination
- Manual continue loops after verification

## Pinning the check and finishing unlock

On a matching short URL, Skip Wait shows an overlay, pins hCaptcha when required, then unlocks and opens the destination after you complete the check. Only short-link paths are covered—not every page on the host.

You keep opening the shared short URL as usual. No paste tool.

## Publisher logins that block the free path

If a publisher auth session is active, free-path unlock can stall even with the extension on. Log out of that publisher session, reopen the short link, and let Skip Wait pin captcha again.
