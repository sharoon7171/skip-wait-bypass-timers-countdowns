Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that covers that card on the short URL, skips the off-site bounce those shares still send, and opens the next URL when Click Here would have.';

const body = `## The task card is the waiting page

[Unlock To Earn](https://unlocktoearn.com/) short aliases do not need a second domain in your address bar. The useful screen is already on unlocktoearn.com/{alias}: a lock-style list (SUBSCRIBE on YouTube, LIKE & COMMENT, Join on Telegram, Join on WhatsApp) and a disabled Click Here to Open Link control that only enables after each row’s delay.

Those rows are on-page theater. They do not contain the next URL. Click Here to Open Link posts a hidden referdomain field on the same alias; that post is what returns the next location. Home, login, and register never start this.

A raw open without Skip Wait can still 302 the tab away. Skip Wait keeps the alias in the tab, shows an overlay over the task card, and completes that same Click Here post in the background.

### What this page is not

It is not a promise of a file host. The post can open a cloud folder, another shortener, or any other http(s) URL the publisher stored. Unlock To Earn support ends when that URL loads.

If LiteSpeed shows Bot verification / reCAPTCHA on the alias, finish the check on the overlay; Skip Wait continues after it.

## Click Here without the subscribe tour

Skip Wait does not click every social row. It does not open YouTube, Telegram, or WhatsApp for this flow. It posts Click Here to Open Link the way the page already does, then navigates to the Location that post returns.

Cosmetic disable-link delays and spinner ticks are ignored. You stay on unlocktoearn.com until the next URL is ready. If a share stops resolving, reload the alias or report it—there is no extra host list to refresh for this brand.
