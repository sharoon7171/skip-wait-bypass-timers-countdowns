Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that preparing countdown bypass so free stream followers bypass busywork is not a multi-minute clock.';

const body = `## Multi-minute Preparing before Start Free Trial

Free follower and free viewer pages embed a trial iframe that holds Start Free Trial behind a Preparing countdown. You fill the channel fields, then sit through the clock—or reload and lose the form—before reCAPTCHA even appears. That is the loop behind streamerviewerbot timer bypass, free trial timer skip, and skip countdown timer searches.

The form is already on the page. Preparing is a client lock on the submit control.

### What the trial iframe holds back

- Preparing countdowns on free trial forms
- Locked Start Free Trial buttons
- Late reveal of reCAPTCHA after the clock
- Lost form state if you refresh mid-wait

## Unlocking ready state inside the iframe

Skip Wait patches the trial iframe countdown so the page runs its own unlock path immediately. Preparing clears, Start Free Trial becomes usable, and you still complete reCAPTCHA before submit—human checks stay with you; the multi-minute theater does not.

Open free stream followers or free stream viewers as usual. That is a Streamerviewerbot bypass extension for skip preparing timer flows, not a paste decoder.
