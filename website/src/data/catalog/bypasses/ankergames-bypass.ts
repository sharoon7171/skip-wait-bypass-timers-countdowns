const body = `## Opening Treasure Box before the file

Clicking Download on an AnkerGames game page does not hand you the file right away. The site sends you to an Opening Treasure Box waiting page—progress chrome, pirate phrases, and an initializing download countdown—before the download buttons are ready. Multi-part games repeat that same ankergames download timer ritual for every chunk.

The page is built to keep you on the waiting hop. You still need the site’s own quick check when it appears; the busywork is the countdown theater layered on top.

### What the waiting page inserts

- Initializing Download progress before controls unlock
- Treasure-box countdown chrome and animated status lines
- Holds that keep download buttons hidden until the timer finishes
- Extra waits stacked on top of the human check

## Clearing the timer inside Chrome

Skip Wait runs on the AnkerGames waiting page you already opened from Download. It removes the initializing countdown so the page sits in its ready state without the progress theater. A short on-page note confirms the wait timer is gone. When the quick check is solved, the site’s own download buttons unlock—you press them yourself; the extension does not auto-start the file.

That is an ankergames timer bypass and treasure box skip in one step: the official Download path stays intact, and only the waiting-page delay is stripped. No paste tool and no hunting a hidden CDN link behind the animation.

## What still needs a real click

The quick check on the treasure-box page is still the site’s gate. Skip Wait does not pretend that check away. It only clears the countdown delay so you are not babysitting initializing download progress after the check is already done—or while it is still running. Finish the check, use the unlocked buttons, and move on to the next part the same way.
