  'A dl.surf bypass matters when Continue to Download opens an ads modal with countdown steps before the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that skips those ad timers on supported file pages and unlocks the download with the account you already signed in with.';

const body = `## Continue to Download that turns into ads

dl.surf file pages look ready until you press Continue to Download. That click opens an ads modal: banner waits, another banner, a video timer, then a human check. Close the modal or miss a step and you start over. That loop is why a dlsurf download bypass, dlsurf ads timer skip, and dl.surf skip ads path matters.

Signing in does not remove the ads wall for free users. The account is required for the download unlock; the ads modal is still the busywork in front of the file.

### What stalls the save

- Continue to Download opening the ads modal
- Banner and video countdowns before the file link
- Human check after the timers
- Reloading the file page when the modal is closed mid-wait
- Looking signed in in the header while the download unlock still asks for a fresh sign-in

## Skip Wait on the file page

On a supported dl.surf file page, Skip Wait places a Skip Ads & Timers panel above Continue to Download. When your dl.surf session is live, it runs the quick human check in that panel and unlocks the real download link. When the session is missing or expired, it asks you to sign in on dl.surf first — Skip Wait does not invent an account; it uses yours.

You still prove you are human when the host requires it. You do not sit through the ads timers or hunt for the buried download control under the modal. If unlock fails after the check, use Try again on the panel instead of restarting the whole ads path.

## Your account, not a paste tool

dl.surf unlocks downloads for signed-in users. Skip Wait keeps that model: open the file while logged in, complete the check in the Skip Wait panel, then tap Download File · Skip Wait. No third-party paste site and no cookie tricks — just the account session already on the tab.

A profile name in the header is not always enough. If Skip Wait still shows Sign In required, sign in again on dl.surf, reopen the file, and let the panel finish the human check once the session is live.
