const body = `## Software listings that stall on please-wait

OceanofDMG Mac software pages often sit a generating or please-wait screen between the download click and the signed CDN URL. You press download, watch a timer strip, then hope the package starts before an overlay forces another round—classic oceanofdmg timer bypass and direct download bypass territory.

The listing already knows the file. The wait page is theater for free visitors.

### CDN button path

1. Open the software listing
2. Click the normal download control
3. Skip Wait resolves the signed CDN URL the page prepares
4. The transfer starts without a separate paste step

## Opening the signed file from the button

Skip Wait watches the download control inside Chrome. After your click it fetches the real CDN link in the background, clears client-only generating delays, and starts the file path when the host allows it.

Required server handshakes still finish. What disappears is babysitting intermediary redirect pages—the practical OceanofDMG bypass extension reading of file host bypass and skip waiting page on these listings.
