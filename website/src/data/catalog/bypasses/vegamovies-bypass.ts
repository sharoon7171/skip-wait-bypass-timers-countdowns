  'A Vegamovies bypass or vglist bypass search usually means Quick Access parked you on a “securing connection” delay before VegaMovies, RogMovies, Anime, or Xprime. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that resolves the live destination from that connecting page so skip landing wait is not a forced hub timer.';

const body = `## Hub Quick Access, then a connecting stall

The Vegamovies hub does not open the live server in one click. Quick Access routes through a connecting page with a securing-connection style wait before VegaMovies, RogMovies, Anime, or Xprime. Refresh mid-wait or lose the tab and you sit through the same landing page bypass loop again.

That hub delay—not a shortener countdown—is why people also search vegamovies timer bypass and mirror site bypass next to skip landing wait.

### Delays before the live mirror

- Landing-page connection stalls after Quick Access
- Securing-connection redirects on the hub
- Forced waits before each live server open
- Restarting the hub when a hop fails

## Opening live servers without the connecting tour

Skip Wait runs on the hub pages inside Chrome. Use Quick Access as usual; the extension resolves the live destination from the connecting page and skips the wait so the chosen server opens immediately.

You are not watching a connecting spinner for every mirror. Required hub routing still happens; the forced delay chrome does not.

## Mirrors that move between hub updates

Bookmarking yesterday’s live URL fails when mirrors rotate. A Vegamovies bypass extension that reads the connecting page destination stays useful without chasing every new mirror by hand.
