const body = `## A Download button that still makes you watch a bar

[GETMODSAPK](https://getmodsapk.com/) lists several builds on the first download screen—each row is a **Download** control. That click does not start the APK. It opens a second file page with thank-you copy, a filling progress bar, and the real **Download** control hidden until the bar finishes.

That getmodsapk 5 second wait is the choke point. You already picked the build you want; the file page still runs a getmodsapk progress bar as if the link were being prepared. A getmodsapk timer bypass and download timer skip matter here because the wait is only that filling track—not a missing file.

### What you sit through after the listing click

- First screen: one Download row per build
- File page: thank-you line plus a horizontal progress track
- Five seconds of bar fill before Download appears
- Download again once the bar is gone
- A report-a-problem control that is separate from the wait

## Skip Wait on the GETMODSAPK file page

Skip Wait is a GETMODSAPK bypass chrome / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On a supported file page it skips the progress fill so Download is visible immediately, with a short Skip Wait notice in the same card as the button.

You stay on GETMODSAPK. Pick the build on the listing, land on the file page, and use Download without a getmodsapk countdown bypass stare-down. That is skip getmodsapk waiting-page busywork and skip waiting page relief on the hop that actually stalls.

## Listing choice versus file-page delay

The listing is where you choose which APK. The file page is where the please wait bypass is needed. Close the tab during the fill, miss Download when it finally appears, or start over on another build and you watch the same bar again.

A GETMODSAPK bypass extension only removes that file-page delay. You still tap the Download row you want. Multi-build posts keep every Download row; skip countdown timer treatment applies when that row opens the filling-bar page—bypass getmodsapk delay without losing which package you picked.
