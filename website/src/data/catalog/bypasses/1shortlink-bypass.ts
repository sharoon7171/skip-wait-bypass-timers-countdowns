const body = `## Ad shortener shares that stall on Continue

1shortlink shares almost never resolve in a single hop. You land on a please-wait screen, dig for skip click to continue under ad chrome, and sometimes restart if you refresh too early. That loop is what people mean by 1shortlink waiting page, 1shortlink timer bypass, and ad link shortener bypass—not a hard destination, just a gate built to burn attention.

### Controls that keep the tab busy

- Timed please-wait strips before unlock
- Continue buttons buried beside rotating creatives
- Gate chrome that sits between the short alias and the long URL
- Restarts when a mistimed click resets the client timer

## Clearing the gate without babysitting ads

Skip Wait’s 1shortlink support runs on the live waiting page in Chrome. It advances the continue flow the shortener already expects, skips cosmetic delay theater, and redirects to the long URL attached to that share. One 1shortlink bypass extension install covers matching pages—no paste box and no userscript pack.

If a step still needs a real hold before unlock, the extension finishes that hold honestly, then continues. That keeps a 1shortlink countdown bypass stable instead of inventing a zero-second cheat that errors out.
