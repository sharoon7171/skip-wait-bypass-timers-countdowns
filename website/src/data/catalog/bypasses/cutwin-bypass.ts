const body = `## Cut-style aliases that land on blog gates

Cutwin-style shorteners rarely hand you the destination in one click. You leave the short alias, land on a blog-style gate with a please wait screen or click-to-continue loop, then finally unlock. Close the tab early, miss the control under ads, or refresh mid-wait and the same cutwin waiting page hunt starts over.

That friction is why cutwin timer bypass, blog waiting page bypass, and cut url shortener bypass searches stay next to generic please wait bypass queries—the pain is the gate, not finding the long URL.

### What the blog gate inserts

- Blog waiting pages before the real URL
- Please-wait strips that re-enable Continue on a client clock
- Gate chrome between the short alias and the destination
- Manual continue loops under overlays

## Advancing Continue under the article chrome

Skip Wait’s Cutwin support runs inside Chrome on the waiting page you already opened. It detects the delay layer, advances the continue flow the page expects, and sends you to the destination without hunting buttons through ads.

Client-only clutter gets out of the way; required waits still finish honestly.

      'It is a way to skip the blog waiting page gate on Cutwin-style short links. Skip Wait runs in Chrome, clears the please-wait step, and opens the destination when unlock is ready.',

  {
    question: 'Does Skip Wait skip every timer instantly?',
    answer:
      'It removes busywork and client-only delays. When a step still requires a real wait before unlock, Skip Wait stays on that step until it is allowed, then continues—a reliable cutwin countdown bypass, not a fake zero-second cheat.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to click Continue on the waiting page?',
    answer:
      'No. On supported gates Skip Wait completes the continue flow so you are not hunting click-to-continue buttons through ads.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will this still work when the blog gate changes layout?',
    answer:
      'Yes for the supported unlock pattern. Skip Wait follows how the waiting page behaves, so a reshuffled gate in the same flow does not force you into a third-party paste tool.',
