const body = `## Get Link locked behind a timer

Droplink is an AdLinkFly-style shortener: the shared alias opens an unlock page, runs a visible countdown, and only then reveals Get Link or the final file path. Ads sit around the timer, and closing the tab mid-countdown often kills the session so you start the same Droplink timer bypass from scratch.

Some publishers wire Droplink behind other gates first—safe redirects, PLEASE WAIT blogs, and step screens—so the unlock page is the last hop, not the first tab you open.

### What slows you down on the unlock page

- A client countdown before Get Link becomes usable
- Disabled or hidden unlock buttons until the clock finishes
- Ad clutter around the timer that makes the real control easy to miss
- A lost session when you reload or switch tabs too early

## Finishing unlock on the live Droplink page

Skip Wait runs on supported Droplink alias pages once the AdLinkFly unlock shell is present. It advances the get-link path the page already expects, clears client-only countdown theater, and opens the file when the shortener allows it. You keep the same shared link—no paste box and no third-party decoder tab.

When the shortener still enforces a real server-side hold, Skip Wait stays on that step until unlock is valid. That keeps a Droplink bypass stable instead of faking a zero-second cheat that errors out on the next click.

## When the share arrived through Tech8s or Ez4Short

Many Droplink aliases only load the unlock page after [Tech8s / Ez4Short](/sites/tech8s-ez4short-bypass) safe redirects and blog gates finish. Skip Wait covers both sides: the tour collapses on supported gate pages, then the Droplink countdown clears on the unlock tab you land on.

Paste unlock tools often fail here because AdLinkFly expects a live browser session with the right cookies. A skip wait extension install stays on the tab you opened, which is why link shortener bypass inside Chrome beats one-shot unshorten forms for Droplink.
