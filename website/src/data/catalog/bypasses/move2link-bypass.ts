const intro =
  'Looking for a Move2Link bypass or please wait bypass usually means a short link sent you through blog session waits and a go page before the real URL. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears those waiting pages so continue loops stop eating the session.';

const body = `## Shortener entry, blog middle, go-page exit

Move2Link shares are built as a tour. You leave the short URL, sit through blog session tracking, then land on a go page with please-wait and click-to-continue chrome. Miss a hop, close a tab early, or lose the session cookie and the whole chain restarts—classic fuel for move2link timer bypass, waiting page bypass, and skip click to continue searches.

That stacked path is different from a single interstitial. Progress depends on blogs cooperating before the go page will release the destination.

### Continue loops people restart by hand

Blog hops hide Continue under ads until a client timer flips. The go page repeats the pattern with another please-wait strip. Each screen expects you to babysit the button; leave mid-flow and Move2Link treats you as a new visitor.

## Following the live waiting-page path

Skip Wait treats Move2Link as a skip waiting page flow inside Chrome. On supported hosts it detects the gate, advances please-wait steps when the page allows, and redirects to the destination without asking you to click continue on every hop.

Client clutter gets out of the way; required holds still finish honestly. Paste tools fail when intermediate blogs rotate. A Move2Link bypass extension that follows behavior—not a hardcoded hop list—stays useful for link shortener bypass and skip waiting page searches as long as the pattern matches.
