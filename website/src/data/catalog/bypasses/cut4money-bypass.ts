  'A Cut4Money bypass search usually means a short alias turned into a tour of blog mediators and unlock waits before the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that follows that redirect chain so skip multi step waits does not mean clicking Continue on every filler page.';

const body = `## Blog mediators stacked into a shortener tour

Cut4Money-style shares are built as a chain, not a single interstitial. You leave the shortener, land on rotating article hops—often insurance or crypto themed filler—tap continue, then bounce again before the final unlock. Close one hop early and the whole redirect chain bypass hunt restarts. That stack is what people mean by cut4money redirect chain, blog mediator bypass, and multi page unlock bypass.

### Stages that eat the session

- Blog mediator hops in the redirect chain
- Multi-step countdown waits between pages
- Session tracking steps between shortener and destination
- Lost progress when a hop opens in the wrong tab

## Following mediators until the final open

Skip Wait treats Cut4Money as a multi-step wait. On the short URL it starts the chain; on each supported mediator it advances the continue flow the page already expects, then follows the next location without you hunting buttons through overlays. When the final unlock is ready, it opens the destination already tied to the share.

Cosmetic client delays clear; required holds still finish honestly.

## When a hop host rotates mid-week

Paste tools break the moment the next mediator domain appears. A Cut4Money bypass extension install stays useful because it keys off hop behavior—continue gates, unlock release—not a hardcoded blog list you update by hand. That is the practical reading of skip multi step waits here: one extension, the live chain, less time restarting Continue screens.
