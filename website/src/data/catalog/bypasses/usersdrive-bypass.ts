  'A UsersDrive bypass or Create Download Link countdown search usually means a file page forced a timer, then an ad mediator, before the real CDN URL. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that posts the create-download form, reads the CDN link, and starts that file from a branded button after Turnstile when required.';

const body = `## Create Download Link as a timer wall

UsersDrive free saves put a countdown in front of Create Download Link. After the timer you may still hit an intermediate HTML page or an ad mediator popup instead of the CDN file. Fail Turnstile, close the wrong tab, or click a fake download and you restart the same skip countdown loop.

That stack is why people search usersdrive timer bypass, countdown timer bypass, and cdn download bypass together.

### What eats the click after Turnstile

- Create Download Link countdown chrome
- Intermediate create-link HTML pages
- Ad mediator popups on download click
- Hunting for the real CDN URL under noise

## Posting the form and reading the CDN URL

Skip Wait runs on the file page inside Chrome. After you complete Turnstile if it appears, the extension posts the create-download form, reads the CDN file URL from the response, blocks mediator popups, and puts that download on a branded Free Download button.

You are not watching the clock or chasing alveridium-style popups. The timer UI goes away; the real CDN path stays.

## Mediator popups that rotate weekly

Userscripts that only auto-click Create Download Link break when the next popup skin appears. A UsersDrive bypass extension that resolves the CDN URL from the form response stays useful without a paste tool.
