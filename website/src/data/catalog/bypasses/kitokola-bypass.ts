const body = `## Download buttons that start a clock first

Kitokola posts often put a countdown between the click and the file path. You press download, watch the timer, then finally get the host or direct link. The archive does not change during that pause.

That is why kitokola timer bypass and download timer skip sit next to direct download bypass: people want the file, not another forced delay on every press.

### What the countdown actually delays

- On-page timers after Download clicks
- Intermediary screens before the file path appears
- Extra waits that repeat on mirror-style buttons
- Manual refreshes when the countdown stalls mid-way

## Opening the file from the same click

Skip Wait watches the download UI you already use. Instead of sitting on the generating or countdown chrome, it fetches the direct link and starts the file path when the host allows it.

You stay on the post—no paste tool. Client-only wait UI gets out of the way; any host-enforced release still finishes honestly.

## Forced delays that never improve the download

Watching the clock on every file wastes time without changing the bytes. A Kitokola bypass extension install keeps the direct path on supported pages so the button you pressed opens the file instead of another countdown.
