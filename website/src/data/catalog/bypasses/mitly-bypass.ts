  'A Mitly bypass or skip timer unlock search usually means a short URL dumped you into a gate wait and countdown instead of the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears those unlock layers on the live shortener page.';

const body = `## Short links that open as gates first

Mitly shares behave like classic ad shorteners: gate wait, sometimes a captcha-style check, then a countdown before Get Link or Continue works. The destination is already decided; the page just refuses to release it until the UI cooperates. Close early or fail the check and you replay the same shortener flow—why mitly timer bypass, link shortener bypass, and skip waiting page spike together.

### Gate → check → countdown

The free path most visitors see is sequential. First a holding screen. Then a human-shaped check when the shortener wants one. Only after that does the unlock clock run and the continue control enable. Each stage can reset independently if the tab loses focus or an overlay eats the click.

## Advancing unlock on the live page

Skip Wait’s Mitly support runs inside Chrome on the short link you opened. It covers client-only unlock timers and continue busywork so get-link is no longer a fake wait wall. When a real delay or check remains, the extension stays until the page allows progress, then opens the destination.

Paste boxes break when gate layouts rotate. A Mitly bypass extension that keys off unlock behavior keeps working without re-copying the URL into another site each week—the durable version of skip countdown and countdown timer bypass for this host.
