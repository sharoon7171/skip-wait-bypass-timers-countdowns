const body = `## Ad shorteners that monetize the unlock clock

Ouo shares are classic get-link walls: open the short URL, sit through a countdown, hunt Continue, then finally leave for the destination. Mistime the button or fight an overlay and the same unlock restarts—why ouo timer bypass and ouo skip queries stay common next to generic ad-link frustration.

Both public Ouo fronts in this catalog share that countdown-and-continue shape even when the hostname differs.

### Get Link as the choke point

The destination is decided before you arrive. The page’s job is to delay Get Link until the timer and continue UI cooperate. Skip Wait covers that unlock chrome inside Chrome so bypass ouo means less babysitting, not inventing a fake redirect.

When a step still needs a real hold, the extension stays until unlock is allowed, then continues—stable ouo get link bypass instead of a brittle zero-second cheat.
