const body = `## Entry hops that stall before the catalog

Shared PRMovies links often dump you on a please-wait or continue screen before the real homepage. You watch a timer, hunt a buried control through ads, or refresh when the landing hop freezes—then start over. That loop is what people mean by prmovies timer bypass, waiting page bypass, and skip click to continue.

The landing page is not the catalog. It is a delay layer whose only job is to hold you until Continue unlocks and the streaming URL finally loads.

### Stages that waste the first visit

- Please-wait strips on the entry hop
- Click-to-continue gates before titles appear
- Countdown delays that reset if you leave the tab
- Stalled landings that need a manual reload

## Clearing the gate inside Chrome

Skip Wait’s PRMovies support runs when the landing page loads. It advances the same continue path the entry flow already uses, then sends you to the main streaming URL the page was going to open anyway.

No paste decoder, no userscript per profile—just a PRMovies bypass extension that treats the wait as automation. Client chrome gets out of the way; any hold the entry still enforces finishes honestly.

Bookmarking a “final” homepage fails when entry paths rotate. The extension follows live landing behavior, so a skip wait extension install keeps working as long as the wait pattern stays the same.
