const intro =
  'People searching an iCutLink bypass or icutlink go page skip usually clicked a monetized short URL and landed in blog waits plus a go-page countdown instead of the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that walks those gates and finishes unlock without you hunting Continue on every hop.';

const body = `## Go pages after a tour of blog waits

An iCutLink share chains verification gates, article continues, and a go-page countdown before the destination appears. Captcha-style checks can sit mid-chain so you cannot finish the short link in one click.

That is why icutlink timer bypass and monetized link bypass sit next to generic short link bypass searches—the friction is the sequence of gates, not one cosmetic timer.

### The free path most visitors take

1. Survive short-link verification and ad gates
2. Advance multi-step blog waits and continue screens
3. Sit through the go-page countdown until unlock enables
4. Hope nothing reset the session mid-chain

## Automating the short link inside Chrome

Skip Wait’s iCutLink support follows the live unlock path. It advances supported gates and blog hops, covers go-page countdown busywork, and opens the destination when the page is ready.

Timers the shortener still enforces server-side are waited honestly. Client-only clutter and disabled unlock buttons get out of the way. That is skip short link as a browser session—not a paste box that breaks when the next mediator rotates.

## Paste APIs vs staying on the live gates

Third-party bypass paste sites often die when iCutLink moves blog or go hosts. An icutlink bypass chrome install that runs on the pages you opened keeps following the same unlock pattern without re-copying the URL each week.
