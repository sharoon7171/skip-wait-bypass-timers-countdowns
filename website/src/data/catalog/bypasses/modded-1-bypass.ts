const body = `## A Download button that still makes you watch Loading…

[MODDED-1](https://modded-1.com/) opens a version download URL after you pick a build. That page shows a **Loading…** progress bar while **Download** stays hidden for four seconds.

That modded-1 4 second wait is the choke point. The download URL is already on the button; the stall is only a client \`setTimeout\`. A please wait bypass and download timer skip matter here because nothing is still being fetched—the loading bar is theater.

### What you sit through on the file page

- Loading… progress bar across the download slot
- About four seconds before the bar clears
- Download once the timer ends
- A Note box about Play Protect and install tips

## Skip Wait on the MODDED-1 download page

Skip Wait is a MODDED-1 bypass chrome / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On a supported download page it skips the loading timeout so Download is visible immediately, with a short Skip Wait notice in the site’s own Note box style.

You stay on MODDED-1. Open the download URL, and use Download without a modded-1 timer bypass stare-down. That is skip modded-1 waiting-page busywork and skip waiting page relief on the hop that actually stalls.

## Listing choice versus file-page delay

The listing is where you choose which APK. The \`/download/N\` page is where the please wait bypass is needed. Leave mid-load, miss Download when it appears, or reopen the download URL and you watch the same Loading… bar again.

A MODDED-1 bypass extension only removes that file-page delay. You still open the build you want and use Download on that page—bypass modded-1 delay without a paste tool.
