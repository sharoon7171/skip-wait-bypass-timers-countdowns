const body = `## Storefront clicks that pause before the archive

openDesktop, KDE Store, and related Pling storefronts often insert a short redirect or generating wait between your download click and the actual theme, plasmoid, or VLC add-on package. Click, wait, hope the file starts—fuel for pling / opendesktop timer bypass, download timer skip, and skip waiting page searches when you only wanted the archive.

### Same delay pattern across sibling stores

VLC add-on pages, KDE project pages, and openDesktop listings share the habit even when branding differs. Refreshing the wait page or hopping mirrors rarely helps if every host uses the same post-click delay.

## Resolving the package on the live store button

Skip Wait runs inside Chrome on matching store pages. After you click download it resolves the real file URL the store already prepares, skips client-only delay pages, and lets the transfer begin. You keep the normal store button—no paste workflow.

Required server handshakes still finish. What disappears is busywork redirect theater—the practical Pling / openDesktop bypass extension reading of file host bypass on these storefronts.
