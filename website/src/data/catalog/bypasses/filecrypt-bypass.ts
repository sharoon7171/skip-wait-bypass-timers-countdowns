const body = `## Mirror lists locked behind I am human

Filecrypt containers hide the download host list until a human verification check passes. You land on the folder page, face the I am human gate, and only then see mirrors. Refresh mid-check or fail the widget and the same lock screen returns—exactly the loop behind human verification bypass and Filecrypt bypass extension searches.

The destination is not a single file URL; it is the unlocked mirror list you still choose from.

## Unlocking hosts so you can pick a mirror

Skip Wait activates on supported Filecrypt container pages. It advances the security-check path the site already expects, unlocks the mirror list, and leaves host selection to you. You are not auto-sent to a random mirror; you still pick Mega, Rapidgator, or whatever the publisher listed.

Client lock-screen busywork stops owning the tab. If a real human widget still appears, finish it once; afterward the list stays reachable so skip security check stays practical inside Chrome.

## Security check busywork vs choosing a host

Paste tools that claim a Filecrypt bypass often return a guessed single link and miss multi-mirror containers. A skip wait extension that unlocks the live list matches how publishers actually share files—one container, several hosts, your choice.
