  'A HubCloud bypass, vcloud bypass, or HubCDN download timer skip usually starts after a cloud-drive page shows a generating wait instead of the file. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that covers that page with an overlay and opens the next download-links page without the forced delay.';

const body = `## Cloud drives that invent a generating pause

HubCloud, vcloud, and HubCDN mirrors often sit a download wait, generating timer, or intermediary redirect in front of the real file. The bytes are already on the host—the pause only delays the path you clicked.

That is why direct download bypass and cloud drive download bypass searches pair with hubcloud timer bypass and vcloud bypass: people want the file URL, not another spinner after every mirror press.

### What stalls after you press download

- Generating timers on cloud-drive buttons
- Intermediary redirect pages before the file starts
- Extra wait screens that repeat on each mirror
- Manual retries when the generating page hangs

## Overlay, then the download links page

On a matching HubCloud or vcloud drive page, Skip Wait draws a full-page overlay so the noisy download UI cannot steal clicks. It resolves the same next download-links URL the finished generating flow would open, then navigates there automatically.

No paste tool and no extra tap on this step—client-only wait chrome stays under the overlay while the real links page loads.

## One install across rotating storage hosts

Mirrors reshuffle while the generating pattern stays familiar. A HubCloud bypass extension that runs on the live page keeps the hop working across supported storage hosts—including vcloud.zip and vcloud.fit—without relearning each mirror’s delay UI.
