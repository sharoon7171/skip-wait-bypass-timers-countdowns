const body = `## Chat embeds stuck on a long iframe load

Coomeet embeds often put a multi-minute countdown inside an iframe before the chat or video UI becomes usable. You are not waiting on a shortener hop—you are waiting on embedded chrome that pads load time. That is why coomeet loading screen skip, iframe timer bypass, and skip embedded wait queries describe a different pain than classic Get Link pages.

### What the frame shows

- Embedded iframe countdown timers
- Long please-wait loading screens before the UI
- Client clocks that stretch far past real asset load
- Repeated stalls when the embed reloads

## Compressing please-wait inside the frame

Skip Wait shortens the embedded please-wait countdown on supported Coomeet iframe pages so the frame finishes loading much sooner. One Coomeet Iframe bypass extension install covers matching embeds—no paste tool and no userscript for a loading clock.

You still get the chat or video surface the embed was going to show; the extension only compresses the busywork timer that sat in front of it.
