  'Shared VexFile links look simple—open the download card, verify you are human, tap Generate link—yet most people never land on the file. After Cloudflare Turnstile they hit Step 2 pages, fake green buttons, and Complete an offer to unlock while Checking completion spins. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that covers that card, keeps Turnstile visible in its overlay, then shows Direct Download · Skip Wait with filename, size, and the real file URL.';

const body = `## Generate link that opens an offer wall

VexFile monetizes free traffic with layered gates on the download card. You solve Turnstile, press Generate link, and instead of a save dialog you meet pre-download warnings, offer walls, and visit-this-page detours that open extra tabs. Mods and APKs shared from Discord or Telegram often use this host, so how to download from VexFile, VexFile generate link bypass, and VexFile offer wall searches spike when Checking completion never ends.

Close the wrong tab or miss the buried control and you are back on Generate link with no progress.

### Locker layers that kill the save

- Buried Generate link presses after Turnstile
- Step 2 offer walls that demand Complete an offer
- Checking completion loops on the content locker
- Pre-download detours and fake download buttons under ads

## Overlay, human check, then one Direct Download

On a supported file page, Skip Wait draws a full-page overlay so the noisy card underneath cannot steal clicks. Filename and size stay visible. If Turnstile is required, the same check is pinned into the overlay—you still prove you are human without digging under ads. After that, Skip Wait reads the page’s Generate link target, resolves the real file URL VexFile would expose after Step 2, and places it on Direct Download · Skip Wait.

Nothing starts until you tap it. No surveys, no paste into random websites. ## Offer walls that keep inventing Step 2

Userscripts that only auto-click Generate link die when the locker skin changes. A VexFile chrome extension that resolves the real download URL under the overlay stays useful while that pattern holds—without finishing Complete an offer.

    question: 'Does Skip Wait remove the Cloudflare check on VexFile?',
    answer:
      'No. When Turnstile is required, you still complete Verify you are human—but the widget is shown inside the Skip Wait overlay so you are not hunting under ads.',

    question: 'What happens to Generate link?',
    answer:
      'You do not need it. Skip Wait follows the same destination Generate link would open, prepares the real download URL, and puts it on Direct Download · Skip Wait.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will I still see Complete an offer to unlock?',
    answer:
      'The offer wall stays under the locked overlay and is not part of the download path Skip Wait uses. You should not need surveys or locker tasks.',

    question: 'Does the APK start downloading automatically?',
