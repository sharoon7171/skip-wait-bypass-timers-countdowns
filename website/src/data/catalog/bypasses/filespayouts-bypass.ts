const body = `## Free Download that still forces a countdown

FilesPayouts monetizes free traffic with a Free Download control that normally opens a countdown page, Create Download Link delay, or intermediary screen before the real file link. Premium may skip the line; free users babysit the clock.

That free-path stall is why filespayouts timer bypass, direct download bypass, and download timer skip sit next to FilesPayouts bypass extension queries.

## Posting straight through to the file step

Skip Wait labels and watches Free Download on supported pages. When you click it, the extension posts through to the download step the finished free path would reach, so the countdown and mediator page never get in the way. You stay on the host; no paste tool.

Client wait theater stops owning the tab. Required holds the host still enforces are waited honestly so the session does not die with a fake zero-second cheat.

## Mediator pages after the free button

Some shares bounce free users through an extra interstitial after Free Download. On supported paths Skip Wait skips that hop so the file path opens when the host allows it. A skip wait extension keeps that file host bypass in one install without a userscript per button.
