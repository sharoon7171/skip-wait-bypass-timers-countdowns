  'An XDMovies bypass or skip landing wait search usually means the entry page forced an Open main site delay before the streaming homepage. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that landing wait so you start browsing without sitting through connection chrome on every visit.';

const body = `## Landing first, homepage second

XDMovies parks the working homepage behind a landing wait. You load the entry URL, watch Open main site / connection delay chrome, then finally reach the streaming homepage. Refresh early and the same landing page bypass loop restarts.

That entry stall—not a file shortener—is why people search xdmovies timer bypass and mirror site bypass next to skip landing wait.

### Entry delays before browsing

- Landing-page connection stalls on load
- Open main site wait screens
- Mirror delays before the homepage
- Restarting the entry URL when a hop fails

## Advancing past Open main site in Chrome

Skip Wait runs on the landing page inside Chrome. It clears the landing wait and opens the working destination so you continue into the site without the forced connection delay.

You visit the same entry URL as always. No paste tool. The delay chrome goes away; the homepage route still completes honestly.

## Entry skins that change between mirrors

Hardcoded “click Open main site after N seconds” habits fail when the landing skin changes. An XDMovies bypass extension keyed to landing-wait release stays useful without relearning each entry layout.
