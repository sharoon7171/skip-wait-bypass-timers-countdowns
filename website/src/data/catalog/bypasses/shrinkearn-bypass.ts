Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that keeps you on the short link, finishes the human check when required, clears those hops, and waits the standard unlock delay on the same tab.';

const body = `## Turnstile on advertisingcamps first

These aliases post Continue to advertisingcamps.com taboola landings. Continue must include a real Cloudflare Turnstile result—Skip Wait does not fake it. It moves the captcha into the Skip Wait card so you can finish the box, then continues automatically.

Miss the check or reload mid-run and you restart on the same card. The session that unlocks the chain lives in that tab.

### Screens you actually see

- Verify you are human with Turnstile on the short link
- Rotating blog articles with Continue-style hop forms
- Your Link Is Almost Ready with a seconds readout and Get Link
- Download or Get a link tiles around the page that are ads—not unlock

## Blog hops after camps

After a valid Continue, the shortener sends you through rotating blog hosts with hop forms that must post back to the alias. Skip Wait submits those hops with the cookies the blogs expect and returns to the unlock shell on the short link you opened.

Leave during a hop, close the wrong tab, or reload and the chain starts again without ad_form_data on the unlock page.

## Your Link Is Almost Ready

The unlock page runs a short seconds counter before Get Link unlocks. Skip Wait waits that standard delay, then finishes Get Link and opens the destination.

Client chrome gets out of the way; server-side holds still finish honestly. That is a ShrinkEarn bypass that stays on one tab from the short URL you opened.

      'Yes when advertisingcamps requires it. Skip Wait pins that check in the overlay, then takes over once the token is valid.',
