  'An Earnlinks bypass matters when a shared short URL wants Click Banner Wait & Back articles and a Your link is almost ready Get Link screen before anything useful opens. Skip Wait is a Chrome extension that keeps you on the short link, clears those hops, and finishes unlock—including a LinksGo second hop or an Alpharede handoff when the shortener continues there.';

const body = `## Short links that demand a blog tour first

A typical Earnlinks share does not open your file in one step. The short URL tries to park you on rotating news-style blogs with Click Banner Wait & Back instructions, long on-page timers, and Continue buttons that only appear after the wait. Leave early or trip an ad-block wall and the earnlinks timer bypass loop starts over on another article.

Only after that tour would you normally return to an unlock banner titled Your link is almost ready, with a short countdown and a disabled Get Link control. That second layer is where the real destination (or the next shortener) finally appears.

### Stages people actually hit

- Forced jump from the short URL toward partner blog articles
- Click Banner Wait & Back / Continue gates that restart if you leave
- Your link is almost ready unlock with Please wait and Get Link
- Optional second hop into LinksGo or an Alpharede article chain

## Stay on the short link, then unlock

Skip Wait treats Earnlinks as a short-link unlock, not a blog crawl. On supported Earnlinks and LinksGo short URLs it covers the busy UI, finishes the live unlock the shortener already uses after those waits, and opens the next location—destination, LinksGo, or Alpharede—without walking every Click Banner Wait & Back article by hand.

You do not babysit Continue under ads for this flow. Client chrome gets out of the way; the earnlinks countdown bypass and earnlinks get link path stay tied to a real browser session so paste tools that miss Cloudflare or a new blog host are not required.

## When unlock opens LinksGo or Alpharede

Some shares finish Earnlinks and open LinksGo with its own Continue chain. Others unlock into an [Alpharede](/sites/alpharede-bypass) multi-stage tour with touch-ad waits. Stay on the tab—Skip Wait continues with the matching rule. An earnlinks chrome extension install covers the Earnlinks short-link hop; the next brand has its own catalog page when you need that stage alone.
