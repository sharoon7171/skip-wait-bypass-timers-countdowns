  'A FileHippo bypass search usually means you already picked a mirror, hit download, and still sat on a post-click delay before the real file path opened. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that fetches that mirror link when the host allows it so the generating screen does not own the transfer.';

const body = `## After you pick a mirror, another delay

FileHippo software pages often add a wait after the download click—generating chrome, an intermediary redirect, or a short hold before the mirror file link appears. You already chose the build; the extra screen only burns time.

That post-click stall is why filehippo timer bypass, direct download bypass, and download timer skip sit next to FileHippo bypass extension queries across regional storefronts.

## Fetching the real file path from the button

Skip Wait watches the download control you already use. Instead of sitting on a generating screen, it resolves the direct mirror URL in the background and starts the file path when the host allows it. You stay on the product page; no paste tool and no alternate download portal.

Client delay theater gets out of the way. Required holds still finish honestly so the fetch does not fail with a fake instant cheat.

## Same Download click across regional storefronts

Supported regional FileHippo storefronts share the same post-click pattern. One skip wait extension install covers those pages so you are not maintaining a userscript per language site.
