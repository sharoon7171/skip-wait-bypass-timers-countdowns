  'An Alpharede bypass matters when a shared short link dumps you into Alpha Rede blog stages with touch-ad waits, click-ad wait 10 seconds copy, and an ad blocker detected wall before the real file. Skip Wait is a Chrome extension that keeps you on the short link, clears those stages, and opens the destination.';

const body = `## Short links that want a multi-stage blog tour

Alpharede (Alpha Rede) monetizes traffic with several blog stages, not a single redirect. Each stage asks you to touch an ad, wait about ten seconds, and return before the next hop unlocks. Leave the tab, trip an ad-blocker wall, or miss the continue control and the alpharede timer bypass loop starts over on another article host.

The brand may say Alpha Rede while the article hostname keeps changing between shares. That rotating blog shortener pattern is why tools that only know yesterday’s host fail on today’s link.

### Stages people actually hit

- Forced jump from the Alpharede short URL toward partner articles
- Touch-ad / click-ad wait instructions on fake news or lifestyle pages
- Ten-second (or similar) holds that restart if you leave the page
- Progress across several stages before the final destination
- Ad blocker detected overlays that freeze unlock until ads load

## Stay on the short link, then unlock

Skip Wait treats Alpharede as a short-link unlock, not a blog crawl. On supported Alpharede short URLs it covers the busy UI, advances the live multi-stage unlock the site already uses after those ad waits, and opens the destination—without tapping every touch-ad strip or hunting continue labels through banners.

Client chrome and interstitial busywork get out of the way. The alpharede countdown bypass stays tied to a real browser session, so the destination is the one the publisher set for that share.

## When another shortener hands you into Alpharede

Publishers often unlock a first shortener into an Alpharede chain. If that first hop was [Earnlinks](/sites/earnlinks-bypass), stay on the same tab—Skip Wait continues with the Alpharede rule once the Alpharede short link opens. An alpharede chrome extension install covers the Alpharede hop; the prior shortener has its own catalog page when you need that stage alone.
