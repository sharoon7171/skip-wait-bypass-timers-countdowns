A typical Sub2Unlock share is a creator locker, not a shortener timer. Fans are told to subscribe, hit the bell, like the video, leave a comment, or share—then often follow on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter—before the unlock control turns usable. Miss one block or fight overlays and the whole sub2unlock timer bypass hunt restarts.

The destination is commonly already embedded in the page’s unlock data. The product is forcing every social proof step before redirect.

### Creator actions this flow usually stacks

- YouTube subscribe, sub and hit bell, sub and like
- Video like, comment, and share requirements

That is a Sub2Unlock bypass extension for social unlock pages—not a multi-slot password locker and not a paste decoder. Client gating disappears; you open the same share URL you already received. If your link uses the Unlock Link button pattern on the .
