  'Looking for an HDHub4u bypass or HDHub4u landing bypass usually means the entry URL parked you on a mirror wait before the catalog. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that landing delay and continues into the working mirror so movies and downloads load without the connection screen.';

const body = `## Entry URLs that stall before the catalog

HDHub4u bookmarks often open a landing wait first: connection delay, open-main-site countdown, rotating entry hosts that still show the same pause. The catalog is not broken—it is gated behind that mirror screen every visit.

That is why hdhub4u mirror bypass and skip landing wait searches spike next to generic landing page bypass queries. People want the working host, not another refresh loop.

### What the landing screen actually costs

- Connection delays before any title list appears
- Open-main-site countdowns on rotating entry hosts
- Manual mirror hunting when the wrong host is bookmarked
- Repeat waits on every return visit

## Clearing the wait into the live mirror

Skip Wait detects the landing pattern on supported entry hosts and advances past it into the current working mirror. You visit the entry URL the same way as always; the extension clears the delay so the catalog loads without babysitting the connection screen.

Supported entry hosts share that landing pattern, so one HDHub4u bypass extension install covers the list without per-mirror toggles.

## Bookmarks vs live entry behavior

Saving a random mirror still leaves you on landing waits when that host rotates. Skip Wait keeps skip landing wait inside Chrome so each visit reaches the live catalog instead of sitting on the entry delay.
