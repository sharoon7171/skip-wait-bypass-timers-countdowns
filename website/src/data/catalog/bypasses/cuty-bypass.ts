  'A Cuty bypass matters when a shared short link on cuttty.com or cuty.io leaves Continue grey, asks for a captcha, then holds another countdown before the destination opens. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that runs that unlock path on supported Cuty pages so you are not babysitting every step.';

const body = `## Continue, captcha, then another clock

Cuty monetizes shares with a multi-step free path: a first Continue gate, a human check when required, then a prepared-link countdown before the destination opens. Miss the unlock moment, close the tab early, or fight overlays for the button and you restart the same skip countdown ritual.

That is a shortener unlock delay, not a mirror host list. On [Mirrored.to](/sites/mirrored-to-bypass), Skip Wait replaces short URL Download buttons with the real host link without opening Cuty at all. This Cuty page is the separate short-link path when another site still sends you through Cuty itself.

### Stages on a free unlock

- First Continue gate after the short link opens
- Captcha before the prepared-link screen when Cuty requires it
- Countdown while the link is prepared
- Final unlock that opens the destination

## Running the unlock path inside Chrome

Skip Wait activates on supported Cuty unlock pages on both Cuty domains. It covers busy UI, advances each unlock step once the page is ready, and holds only for the real countdown the shortener still enforces—then opens the destination. Required captcha stays yours to complete once; fake timer chrome stops owning the tab.

When a share already includes the destination in a quick Cuty link, Skip Wait prefers that destination instead of walking the full unlock tour.

If an adblocker is on for Cuty, the shortener often sends you back to the first gate after the timer. Pause your blocker for this site, reload, and the unlock path can finish.

## Why paste boxes miss the session after captcha

Unshorten paste tools often fail when Cuty expects cookies and a live tab after the captcha. A skip wait extension install keeps the session on the page you already opened, which is the durable reading of link shortener bypass for this host.
