  'Tech8s and Ez4Short shares open a safe redirect, dump you on a PLEASE WAIT blog, then a step 3/3 screen that wants you to watch ads before Continue appears. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that walks that ad-link chain so a skip short link path does not mean tapping every gate yourself.';

const body = `## Safe redirects stacked with rotating blogs

Ez4Short-style ad links are built as a tour. You leave the shortener, hit a safe interstitial, land on a blog article you did not choose, and only then see unlock chrome. Close a tab mid-chain or miss a Continue moment and the tech8s gate page loop restarts from the safe redirect.

Mediators rotate—today’s article host may differ tomorrow—but the pattern stays the same: redirect skin, session cookies, hidden Continue, then the next hop.

### Stops that eat the most time

- Safe-redirect pages that delay the real blog URL
- PLEASE WAIT strips and continue gates on article pages
- Step 3/3 screens styled like DropLink that demand “watch the ad for 10 seconds”
- Extra hops through another safe redirect before the final shortener unlock
- Lost progress when a hop opens in the wrong tab

## Collapsing the live ad-link path in Chrome

Skip Wait treats Tech8s / Ez4Short as a short-link chain, not a paste-box riddle. On safe redirects it reads the real next URL and moves on. On blog gates it completes the continue sequence the page already expects. On step 3/3 screens it opens the next hop without making you sit through ad-tab busywork.

Client chrome gets out of the way; server-side holds still finish honestly—so an ez4short timer bypass stays reliable instead of inventing a zero-second cheat that errors out.

## When the chain ends on Droplink

Many tours finish on [Droplink](/sites/droplink-bypass) with a Get Link countdown on the unlock page. Skip Wait clears the Tech8s / Ez4Short gates first, then the Droplink timer on the tab you land on—one install, both hops covered on supported pages.

Paste unlockers die when mediators rotate or when the final shortener needs cookies from the tour you already finished. A skip wait chrome extension install keys off gate behavior—continue release, step screens, unlock links—not a hardcoded blog list you must update by hand.
