  'A Tfly bypass or Tfly timer bypass search usually means a monetized short URL parked you on a continue gate, captcha, and unlock countdown instead of the real destination. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears those waiting-page steps so skip click to continue is not a manual loop.';

const body = `## Please-wait, then check, then unlock

Tfly shares rarely open the target in one hop. You land on a please-wait style gate, may hit a captcha screen, then sit through an unlock countdown before a Get Link style redirect. Miss a continue, close early, or fight overlays and the same waiting page bypass loop restarts.

That sequence—not a single timer—is why people also search please wait bypass and link shortener bypass next to Tfly.

### Gates that reset progress

- Waiting pages that hide Continue until the client timer ends
- Captcha screens before unlock is allowed
- Unlock countdown chrome on the go step
- Manual continue button loops after a failed hop

## Finishing the short URL on the live gate

Skip Wait’s Tfly support runs inside Chrome on the waiting page you already opened. It skips delay layers the flow already expects, pins captcha when required, and sends you to the target once unlock is allowed.

Client-only busywork disappears; required verification still finishes honestly. That is a skip waiting page path without a paste tool that breaks when the next gate skin changes.

## Layouts that change overnight

Third-party unlock sites often fail when Tfly rotates gate chrome. A Tfly bypass extension keyed to continue release and unlock behavior stays useful as long as that pattern holds—without re-copying the short URL into another website each week.
