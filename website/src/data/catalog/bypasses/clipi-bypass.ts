const body = `## Compact short URLs with a stall screen

Clipi shares look tiny in a chat, then open a please-wait or click-to-continue screen instead of the long URL. Refresh too soon and the same waiting page bypass hunt starts over. That single stall is why clipi waiting page, clipi timer bypass, and url shortener waiting page queries stay common even for a simple alias.

### What sits on the gate

- Please-wait chrome before the long URL
- Skip click to continue controls under ads
- Gate pages between the short alias and the destination
- Manual continue loops when the button hides

## Jumping to the long URL from the gate

Skip Wait detects the Clipi gate in Chrome, advances the continue flow the page expects, and redirects to the long destination without asking you to babysit the timer. One Clipi bypass extension install covers matching pages—no paste tool and no userscript manager.

Client-only delay theater clears; required holds still finish honestly. That keeps a clipi short link bypass reliable instead of inventing a broken zero-second cheat.
