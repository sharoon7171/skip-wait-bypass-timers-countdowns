You land on Unlock content, grind Complete the 5 steps after a popup, browser-install offers, and Quick Step clicks, then sit on Unlocks in while Premium begs you to pay.

const body = `## Unlock content cards that never feel finished

Gaea Operations runs Lockr as monetization middleware. Free visitors hit task stacks that change by device and region—step farms, Download the Best Gaming Browser offers, After the Popup article walls—then a red Unlocks in waitlist or Instant access Premium checkout. Disable your ad-blocker warnings, VPN soft-blocks, and nested lockers (one Lockr pointing at another) make it feel broken rather than monetized. Closing the wrong tab resets progress on the same Unlock content card.

### Noise on a typical free locker

- Offer tasks like Complete the 5 steps and Quick Step clicks
- After the Popup modals and forced pop-unders
- Ad-blocker / VPN screens that stall the card
- Unlock content waitlist timers and Unlocks in countdowns
- Premium Instant access as the only “fast” path

## Overlay on the offer wall, unlock when Lockr releases

When a supported locker loads, Skip Wait covers the offer wall so fake unlock buttons cannot steal the click. It drives Lockr’s unlock path past the task checklist and the long Unlocks in waitlist, then opens the real destination Unlock content would unlock—not a homepage guessed from a favicon. Status text stays plain; surveys, second-browser installs, and Premium trials stay optional for people who want them.

## Nested lockers and waitlists that outlast the checklist

Finishing every checkmark does not always feel finished. Many free lockers stack a long waiting list, nest another Lockr behind the first, or soft-block VPN users. Skip Wait targets that stuck Unlock content state—skip lockr tasks, skip lockr waitlist, and skip lockr premium without buying Instant access.
