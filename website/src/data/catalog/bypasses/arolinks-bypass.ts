  'An Arolinks bypass matters when a shared short link opens a Please Wait screen and tries to dump you onto slow blog pages before any unlock countdown. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that keeps you on the short link, finishes the real hold, and opens the destination without a multi-step blog tour.';

const body = `## Please Wait that wants a blog tour

A typical Arolinks share does not open your file in one click. The short URL shows a Please Wait / Opening Link page, then tries to send you onto rotating article hosts with continue gates and ads. Only after that tour does the unlock screen appear—and another timer can still sit between you and the destination.

Slow or unreachable blog pages make the old path feel broken: the tab hangs, Cloudflare challenges appear, and the Arolinks waiting page loop restarts if you leave early. That is the pain an Arolinks timer bypass and Arolinks countdown bypass are meant to clear.

### Stages people actually hit

- Please Wait / Opening Link on the short URL before anything useful loads
- Forced jumps toward rotating blog hosts that stall or challenge
- Unlock countdown UI after the session is ready
- Timed destination holds on some final links after Get Link

## Stay on the short link, then unlock

Skip Wait treats Arolinks as a short-link unlock, not a blog crawl. On the short URL it blocks the forced hop away, covers the busy Please Wait UI, and holds only as long as the unlock step still requires. When the unlock page is ready, it opens the destination already present there—including through Vplink short links on the same path.

You do not hunt Continue under ads on article pages for this flow. Client chrome gets out of the way; the required unlock hold still finishes honestly so an Arolinks please wait bypass stays stable instead of inventing a zero-second cheat that errors out.

## When the destination still waits

Some destinations need an extra access window after unlock. Skip Wait keeps that hold when it applies, then opens the link. Paste tools often fail when the shortener expects a live browser session—arolinks chrome extension and skip wait extension installs keep that session on the tab instead.
