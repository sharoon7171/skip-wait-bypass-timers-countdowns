const body = `## A Download button that still makes you wait

[ModsManiac](https://modsmaniac.com/) opens a \`/file/\` URL with the APK already in the query string. That page swaps Download out for a progress bar and a countdown that ticks every 900ms for about fifteen seconds before the button returns.

That ModsManiac countdown is the choke point. The APK URL is already on the page; the stall is only a client \`setInterval\`. A please wait bypass and download timer skip matter here because nothing is still being fetched—the wait copy is theater.

### What you sit through on the file page

- Progress bar under the download slot
- “Your link is almost ready, please wait…” counting down
- About fifteen seconds before the bar clears
- Download once the timer ends

## Skip Wait on the ModsManiac file page

Skip Wait is a ModsManiac bypass chrome / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On a supported file page it skips the countdown so Download is visible immediately, with a short Skip Wait notice in the site’s own muted text style.

You stay on ModsManiac. Open the file URL, and use Download without a ModsManiac timer bypass stare-down. That is skip modsmaniac waiting-page busywork and skip waiting page relief on the hop that actually stalls.

## Listing choice versus file-page delay

The listing is where you choose which APK. The \`/file/\` page is where the please wait bypass is needed. Leave mid-countdown, miss Download when it appears, or reopen the file URL and you watch the same progress bar again.

A ModsManiac bypass extension only removes that file-page delay. You still open the build you want and use Download on that page—bypass modsmaniac delay without a paste tool.
