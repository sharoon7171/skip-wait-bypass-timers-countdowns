  'Searching for a Linksterr bypass usually means a short URL opened a gateway waiting page instead of the destination. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that clears that please-wait gate and redirects without you tapping Continue through ads.';

const body = `## Gateway pages that sit between you and the URL

Linksterr puts a waiting gateway after the short link: please wait, click to continue, overlays that hide the real destination until the UI decides you waited long enough. Leave early and you restart the gate.

That is why linksterr waiting page and skip click to continue searches appear next to generic waiting page bypass—the shortener already knows where you are going; the gateway is the product.

### What the gateway adds

- Please-wait screens before any redirect
- Click-to-continue loops under ad clutter
- Gate pages that hold the destination behind UI
- Manual retries when the wrong tab closes mid-wait

## Redirecting when the page already holds the target

Skip Wait detects the gateway, bypasses filler wait chrome when the destination is present, and sends you there without hunting Continue.

You open the short link as usual—no paste tool. Client-only delay UI gets out of the way so the redirect can fire on the live page.

## One waiting pattern, fewer manual steps

Gateway layouts shuffle; the continue-then-redirect behavior stays familiar. A Linksterr bypass extension that runs on that live gate keeps skip waiting page useful without inventing a new paste workflow each week.
