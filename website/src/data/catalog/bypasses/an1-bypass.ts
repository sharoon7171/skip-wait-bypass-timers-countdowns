const body = `## Download waiting page that still forces a countdown

[AN1](https://an1.com/) game and app posts send **Download** to a dedicated download waiting page. A large green timer counts down before the real APK button appears, even though the package link is already on the page. That an1 countdown bypass and download timer skip pain is the freemium stall between the listing and the archive.

You already chose Whiteout Survival or any other title. The next screen still hides the green Download control until the circle finishes—classic apk download waiting page and please wait bypass territory.

### Stages on the way to the file

- Game or app listing with Download
- Download waiting page with the green circle timer
- Hidden Download button until the countdown ends
- Extra store pitches and overlays while you wait
- Finally the APK transfer after the timer clears

## What an AN1 bypass extension clears

Skip Wait is an AN1 bypass extension / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On supported download waiting pages it:

- Hides the green countdown circle immediately
- Reveals the Download button with Skip Wait branding
- Keeps the same AN1 green button style so the page still looks native
- Leaves the direct APK href ready—no paste tool and no second helper

You stay on AN1. The an1 timer bypass targets the waiting-page countdown only; listing pages still open that page, then Skip Wait makes the download available without the wait.

## Countdown skip and direct download

Some visits land straight on the download waiting page after the first click. Close the tab early, miss the reveal, or fight an overlay and you restart the same stall.

A file host bypass for AN1 covers that surface: skip countdown timer treatment shows Download · Skip Wait at once so the APK starts when you tap—direct download bypass without sitting through the circle.
