const body = `## Generating screens between click and file

FastDL sits a download wait, generating timer, or intermediary redirect in front of the real file link. You press the same button you always use, then stare at countdown chrome before the CDN path opens. Miss the moment or refresh mid-generate and you restart the same fastdl timer bypass loop.

That is why direct download bypass, download timer skip, and file host bypass queries cluster around FastDL bypass extension installs—people want the archive from the button, not another gate page.

## Resolving the archive URL behind the button

Skip Wait watches the download click on supported pages. It resolves the real file URL in the background and bypasses the timer or redirect page that normally appears after the click. You stay on the host you already opened; nothing asks you to paste the share into another website.

Client generating theater gets out of the way when the host allows the link. Required holds still finish honestly so the fetch does not fail with a fake zero-second cheat.

## Mirror clicks without a second timer page

Extra wait screens on mirror and host buttons get the same treatment on supported paths: one click, resolved file, fewer intermediary hops. A skip wait extension install keeps that direct download path working without a separate userscript per button.
