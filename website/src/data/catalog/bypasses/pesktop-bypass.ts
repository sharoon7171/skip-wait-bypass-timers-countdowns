const body = `## Direct download that still generates a wait

PeskTop software pages label the control Direct download, then often park you on a downloads waiting page before the signed CDN URL appears. You click, watch generating chrome, and hope the package starts before overlays force another round—classic pesktop timer bypass and download timer skip territory.

The button already knows the file. The wait page is the freemium tax.

### From button click to signed package

Skip Wait watches the Direct download path inside Chrome. After your click it resolves the signed CDN URL the page prepares, clears client-only delay theater, and starts the transfer without a paste box. Required server steps still finish honestly.

Third-party paste sites guess destinations and fail when tokens rotate. A PeskTop bypass extension that follows the live download control stays useful when wait markup reshuffles—same direct download bypass idea as other software listings, tuned to this storefront.
