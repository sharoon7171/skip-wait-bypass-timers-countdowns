const body = `## Get your free key without babysitting the checkpoint

On [CloverHub Access](https://cloverhub.app/getkey), **Get your free key** starts a provider checkpoint—usually LootLabs—then polls until CloverHub can issue a short-lived access key. Close the tab, pick the wrong provider, or sit through the locker timer and you are back at the start.

Skip Wait targets **getkey** on CloverHub: the overlay checks or creates a LootLabs claim, bypasses the LootLabs wait, then shows the key when CloverHub marks the claim complete.

### What you normally click through

- **Get your free key** on the CloverHub page
- **Continue verification →** into a LootLabs unlock link
- A locker countdown and task copy before CloverHub accepts the checkpoint
- A one-time key display once verification finishes

### What Skip Wait changes on getkey

Open **getkey** with Skip Wait enabled. The overlay walks three honest steps: checking your claim, creating one if needed, then bypassing LootLabs. When the key is ready, it appears in the overlay with **Copy key**—nothing is copied until you tap the button.

Linkvertise and PlatoBoost checkpoints on the same page are not auto-bypassed; Skip Wait sticks to LootLabs claims so the flow stays reliable.

For the LootLabs locker itself, see the [LootLabs bypass](/sites/lootlabs-bypass) page—CloverHub reuses that stack, but Skip Wait handles both legs when you start from CloverHub getkey.
