const body = `## Preparing a link that is already there

[Moddroid](https://moddroid.com/) lists the app on a detail page, then opens a file download URL with a token path. That page shows **Préparation du téléchargement, veuillez patienter quelques secondes……** and an orange fill bar while **Download** stays hidden for five seconds.

That moddroid 5 second wait is the choke point. The APK URL is already on the Download control; the stall is only a client \`setTimeout\` plus a CSS progress animation. A please wait bypass and download timer skip matter here because nothing is still being fetched—the prepare copy is theater.

### What you sit through on the file page

- Préparation du téléchargement… with an orange progress track
- About five seconds before the bar finishes
- Download (and on mobile, Download Moddroid APP) once the timer clears
- A yellow notice that an ad may appear before the file starts

## Skip Wait on the Moddroid download page

Skip Wait is a Moddroid bypass chrome / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On a supported download page it skips the prepare timeout so Download is visible immediately, with a short Skip Wait notice in the site’s own ad-notice style.

You stay on Moddroid (including language hosts like fr.moddroid.com). Open the token download URL, and use Download without a moddroid timer bypass stare-down. That is skip moddroid waiting-page busywork and skip waiting page relief on the hop that actually stalls.

## Detail page versus file-page delay

The detail page is where you choose to download. The token file page is where the please wait bypass is needed. Leave mid-fill, miss Download when it appears, or reopen the token URL and you watch the same prepare bar again.

A Moddroid bypass extension only removes that file-page delay. You still open the build you want; Download keeps the site label—bypass moddroid delay without a paste tool.
