const body = `## Preparing a link that is already there

[APKAward](https://apkaward.com/) opens a version download URL after you pick a build. The page shows **Preparing your download link…** and a green timer circle while **Download** stays hidden behind that countdown.

That apkaward countdown is the choke point. The APK URL is already on the Download control; the stall is only the five-second client timer. A please wait bypass and download timer skip matter here because nothing is still being fetched—the prepare copy is theater.

### What you sit through on the file page

- Preparing your download link… with a green timer
- About five seconds before the countdown ends
- Download once the timer clears
- A pink note about closing an ad and clicking Download again

## Skip Wait on the APKAward download page

Skip Wait is an APKAward bypass chrome / skip wait extension path for this catalog. On a supported download page it skips the prepare countdown so Download is visible immediately, with a short Skip Wait note in the site’s own note box style.

You stay on APKAward. Open the version download URL, and use Download without an apkaward timer bypass stare-down. That is skip apkaward waiting-page busywork and skip waiting page relief on the hop that actually stalls.

## Why the prepare screen feels mandatory

Leave mid-count, miss Download when it appears, or reopen the version URL and you watch Preparing your download link… again. An APKAward bypass extension only removes that countdown. You still open the build you want and use Download on that page—bypass apkaward delay without a paste tool.
