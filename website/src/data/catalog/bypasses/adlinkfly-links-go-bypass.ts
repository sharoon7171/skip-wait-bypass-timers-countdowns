  'Links Go waiting pages on linkjust.com, pahe.plus, go.zovo.ink, and shortnest.com stack please-wait seconds, Continue or Proceed, then Get Link. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that runs that interstitial on those hosts so the listed short URL is an overlay, not a manual timer sit.';

const body = `## Please wait, then Get Link again

A Links Go interstitial is built to burn time on the waiting page itself. You hit please wait seconds, tap Continue or Proceed, wait again, then hunt Get Link. Refresh during a timer or miss the control and the same please-wait loop restarts on that host.

Client clocks on these pages are often decorative. The shortener may still reject an early Get Link. That mix—fake seconds plus a real server delay—is why an adlinkfly links go bypass has to finish the live unlock path, not only hide the countdown.

### Interstitial pieces on these hosts

- Please-wait countdown chrome
- Continue and Proceed gates
- Get Link after each wait
- Ad noise around the real control

Coverage on this page is those four domains only. Other shorteners that look similar are separate catalog entries.

## Overlay on the waiting page

Skip Wait matches the waiting page on a listed host, covers it with an overlay, and advances Continue-style steps without extra taps. Captcha stays on the overlay only when the page shows one. Unlock is requested as soon as Links Go accepts it. A rejected early unlock waits the enforced delay once, then Get Link finishes and the tab opens the URL that unlock returned.

That is a continue button bypass and get link shortener bypass for these brands inside Chrome—not a paste box that breaks when a new Links Go skin appears.

## Human checks stay human

Turnstile or a similar widget still needs you once. Skip Wait pins it. After that, please wait seconds and Get Link theater do not need a second pair of eyes. When unlock succeeds, the tab leaves the interstitial on its own.
