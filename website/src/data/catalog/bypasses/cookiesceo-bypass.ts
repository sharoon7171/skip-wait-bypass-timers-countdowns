  'A CookiesCEO bypass search usually means a premium cookie page still forces a wait plus line-by-line copy instructions before the session string is usable. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that fetches the cookie, puts it on your clipboard, and shows a Copy cookie control if you need it again.';

const body = `## Premium cookie pages and copy choreography

CookiesCEO-style pages do not behave like a normal shortener redirect. You wait, then follow manual copy steps to grab a session cookie or share string before downloads unlock elsewhere. That choreography is why copy cookie bypass, session cookie copy, and skip copy step searches show up—people want the data, not the ritual.

### What slows the grab

- Site waits before cookie data is ready
- Line-by-line manual copy instructions
- Repeat visits when the clipboard clear loses the string
- Extra hops that only restate how to paste

## One Copy cookie control instead of waiting

Skip Wait fetches the cookie or share string on supported premium cookie pages, copies it to your clipboard, and surfaces a Copy cookie button if you need another grab. You stay on the cookie page; the CookiesCEO bypass extension removes the wait-and-paste dance without sending you through unrelated gates.

No decoding puzzles and no third-party paste site. The extension works on the live copy flow so session data is easier to reuse when you need it again.
