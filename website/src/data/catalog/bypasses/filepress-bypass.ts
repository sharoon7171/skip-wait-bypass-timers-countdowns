  'A FilePress bypass search usually means Instant or Direct download still forced a generating timer before the file URL appeared. Skip Wait is the Chrome extension that resolves that link in the background so the download button opens the archive without the wait page.';

const body = `## Instant download that still generates first

FilePress labels controls as direct or instant, then parks a generating timer or intermediary redirect between the click and the real file. You press download, watch the clock, and hope the CDN path appears before you refresh and lose progress.

That mismatch—instant branding, timed unlock—is why filepress timer bypass, direct download bypass, and download timer skip cluster around FilePress bypass extension installs.

## Background resolve on the download click

Skip Wait watches the download button on supported pages. It resolves the real file URL in the background and bypasses the timer or redirect page that normally follows the click. You keep using the host you already opened; nothing asks for a paste form.

Client generating chrome gets out of the way when the host allows the link. Required holds still finish honestly so the fetch stays stable.

## Host buttons that add another wait screen

Mirror and host-style buttons often stack a second wait after the first. On supported paths Skip Wait skips those extra screens so your click opens the file link instead of another timer page. A skip wait extension keeps that file host bypass path in one install.
